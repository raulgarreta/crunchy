[{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/06/what-is-the-fate-of-apples-iphone-5c/", "content": "With Apple releasing new iPhones next week, the question arises: what will happen to its existing models? With recent releases, Apple has kept older devices around to serve it at lower price points in certain regions. But which older devices are going, which are staying and what will the prices be? Just as a thought exercise, let\u2019s talk this out. What I would conjecture is that the iPhone 5C is going away, a move that that wouldn\u2019t come as too much of a shock to most, though sales of the device have appeared to pick up lately. Though I personally like the look and feel, and think that it\u2019s well built, the perception is that it\u2019s a \u2018lower end\u2019 device that packs older innards. Apple could easily drop it from the lineup to make room for a new \u2018low end\u2019 unit. That new low end? Probably the iPhone 4S. Yes, it\u2019s 3 years old, but the hardware is still decent and runs iOS 7 (and iOS 8) just fine. But it\u2019s also 3 years old \u2014 that means that Apple has had time to get the manufacturing costs for the device down, way down. By dedicating manufacturing facilities to making these older devices, and using parts and processes that have only gotten cheaper over the intervening years, Apple could afford to charge as little as $300-$350 for the 4S, making it a relatively attractive buy in  places like India, Southeast Asia  and other markets were it needs more penetration outside of the \u2018subsidy-rich\u2019 US. As far as the iPhone 5S, I\u2019d guess that will probably stick around too \u2014 as a \u2018medium end\u2019 subsidized model. If Apple is able to get it to clock in at around $500 then it could have real success as a prestige buy for the mid-tier Chinese customer. And Apple could probably find a way to subsidize it down to the $50-$100 range in the US. Because of its status as a premium unit \u2014 with premium materials \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t fall into the same \u2018unapologetically plastic\u2019 perception trap that the 5C did. Too expensive to be considered \u2018cheap and cheerful\u2019 but too cheap (perceptively) to be considered a status symbol. Of course, I could be wrong and the 5C could stick around for another year.

YC co-founder Paul Graham once referred to the process of finding and nurturing those big hits as \u201c Black Swan Farming .\u201d But how does YC do it? What sets it apart from some of the other accelerators out there, and why does it seem like its alumni companies are disproportionately successful? With the latest episode of  Incubated , we set out to find out. At first glance, Y Combinator doesn\u2019t look that different from most accelerators in part because it defined the category. Founded in 2005, its success has inspired multiple other programs to copy its 12-week format of weekly meetings, partner office hours, and access to alumni and mentors from the tech world. But one of the things that sets it apart from other accelerators is just the depth and breadth of knowledge that exists within its network. In part, that stems from running for so long \u2014 there are about 1,500 YC alums available to learn from. And many of those alumni end up becoming the first partners or customers for startups in a current class. While startups are expected to have their own space, Y Combinator companies meet weekly on Tuesdays to catch up, discuss their progress, and learn from famous entrepreneurs who are invited to talk about their own challenges in scaling up their businesses. It also hosts a series of other events, like  Y Combinator Startup School , that are open to entrepreneurs who wish to attend. One other thing that sets it apart is the selection process: YC takes online applications to help screen applicants, but bases its decision mostly on one 10-minute interview with the accelerator\u2019s partners. It looks for founders who have deep domain expertise, and companies that can be big outliers in different technology. Y Combinator just  opened applications  for its winter class this week. If you\u2019re interested in learning more, check out he video above before applying! This is the fifth of ten episodes for a new TechCrunch TV series called  Incubated . We\u2019ll have a new episode after Wednesday afternoon for the next two-and-a-half months, each of which will take a look at what it\u2019s like inside some of the top accelerators in the U.S. Please join us each week to find out how all the different incubators and accelerators help out the startups that participate in them.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/28/the-promise-and-perils-of-3d-printer-popularity/", "content": "I\u2019ve stopped writing about a few things recently, mostly because of fatigue. First, I\u2019m not that interested in merchants accepting bitcoin \u2013 these little blips are primarily PR moves and little else and I just don\u2019t get as wound up about mass adoption of  BTC  as the true believers. I\u2019m also not interested in covering crowdfunded 3D printers. Same problem: fatigue and little change in the real market or the real conversation. And this is not to say that I won\u2019t cover your printer, makers. I will. You just better have an amazing story to tell and, luckily, many of you do. But I digress. Take a look at this  article by one Chopmeister . He addresses a number of my main concerns in a very straightforward way. \u201cEach minute you spend learning about 3d printing and 3d printers before you commit to buying one will save you a nerve or two in the long run,\u201d he writes in a bit of tortured but important prose. \u201cDon\u2019t fall for the catchwords.\u201d \nAnd that\u2019s all these crowdfunded 3D printers are: collections of \u201ccatchwords\u201d (buzzwords, that is) strung together on the back of a piece of cheap hardware built by manufacturers eager to cash in on the 3D printing craze. While there are many noble and remarkable efforts in this space and there have been many successes in the space, I worry that many of us fools may soon be parted from our money if we\u2019re not careful (myself included.) 3D printing is about to be commoditized. I would argue that the best commodity printer \u2013 the Canon color laser printer of this whole industry \u2013 is the  Makerbot  and the quality and value fall quickly from there from the quite interesting ( Zortrax ,  Monkeyfab ,  Afinia ,  Formlabs ) to the overly-hyped (Buccaneer, Makibox), to the potentially fraudulent. So where does that leave the rest of these printers? Nowhere, really. Once larger manufacturers like HP and Dell see a niche they can exploit, they will swoop in an offer a razors and blades solution for the home 3D printer. The reason they haven\u2019t done this yet is manifold. First, before Stratasys bought Makerbot, there was no real market. A few dozen printers were sold per day and the entire market was taken up by home hobbyists who had little interest in dropping a few thousand for a ready-made unit. Most major 3D printer manufacturers had an odd problem: demand was seemingly huge, and they received more orders than they could comfortably produce. But that was because they couldn\u2019t commoditize the product enough to mass produce and thus depended on local, small manufacturers and even built the items in their offices. They were being drowned by demand but not because they were selling too many printers. They just didn\u2019t have the cash to make those printers quickly enough to satisfy even the small number of orders they received. A few very good companies avoided this trap early on and are doing quite well. Others buckled under the pressure. My concern is that more and more companies will buckle. Take a look at this excellent piece by  Daniel Brown . Brown has estimated that the least expensive 3D printer still costs $300 to make, and most of that is in the rigid metal frame. While the nozzles and the electronics seem like the most expensive parts, they can be churned out en masse while many of these frames and cases are cut at great expense and hand-assembled. A guitar isn\u2019t expensive because of the strings and the machine heads. It\u2019s expensive because it\u2019s expensive to make a body and neck that won\u2019t warp or break. Brown writes: Who is great at making cheap frames and cases? It\u2019s not the guys at OrboPrinter++ or RepRapLite SuperFab. It will be Dell and Samsung and Monoprice who create 3D printers for the rest of the world. And when it happens it won\u2019t be pretty for the little guys. We can also argue whether Samsung will ever release a 3D printer. My engineer brother-in-law sees home 3D printers as hopelessly useless. He works for Honda and they have 3D printers the size of truck trailers spewing out parts. A Makerbot making a Yoda head seems like a frippery. But this would be like the EIC of Random House laughing at the first (expensive) dot-matrix printers. \u201cWe do things so much more efficiently and with an eye for quality,\u201d he\u2019d say, sipping a highball (remember, this is a few decades ago). \u201cWho needs a home printer when they have books you can buy at a store!\u201d Fast forward a few dozen years and now everyone can print letter quality pages at home, school, and in the office and the business case the Random House exec saw \u2013 the replacement of real printing presses by cheap home printers \u2013 didn\u2019t come to pass. While he was chortling at inkjets, the industry was excavated out from under him. The same thing can happen with the manufacturers of injection molding systems, jewelry, and even some electronics. It will take a while, but it will happen. And all of this, the endless jostling, the posturing, and the endless noble effort, will reach its ultimate conclusion: the movement of 3D printing industry and the attendant printers as something to be covered every minute of every day to just another piece of hardware in the average home.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/28/prepare-for-the-smartwatch-assault/", "content": "Consumer electronic companies are giddy. They can\u2019t help themselves. They have a new thing. A new gadget. A new widget to sell to you. After years of notebooks, tablets and boring slabs of metal and glass, Samsung, LG, Motorola and all the rest finally have a chance to build something different: The smartwatch. This is going to be a mess. The smartwatches will come hard and fast. Companies will release iterations at breakneck speed as the engineers and marketers receive feedback from consumers. The giant companies have the reserves to do this. Startups, like Pebble, have one shot to get it right. Samsung was first out of the gate with the Galaxy Gear. Released just last September, the company quickly followed it up with three more models in April. And then another smartwatch three months later. And now, just yesterday,  the company announced another smartwatch , the successor to the original Galaxy Gear Smartwatch. LG is also following suit and  just announced its second smartwatch for 2014 . Apparently the company heard the resounding feedback that consumers want a round-faced smartwatch. Motorola stole the limelight away from LG when the two companies jointly helped Google announce Android Wear. The LG G Watch has a square face and the Motorola 360 circular. All the attention went to the 360\u2019s sexy round LCD and so LG wanted in on the action. The action hasn\u2019t been this exciting since the great netbook craze of 2009. The smartwatch market is reminiscent of the early days of feature phones when cell phone makers were releasing new models seemingly every quarter. At the time Nokia was churning out models that ranged from the mundane to the absurd while others like Sony Ericsson was experimenting with full touchscreens phones and tiny handsets. It was a wild time that led us to the thin RAZR, full-featured SE P900, and the taco-talking N-Gage. Startups do not have the same deep pockets as consumer electronic giants. Their minimum viable product needs to be right on the money \u2014 or, at the very least, built upon a platform that can be upgraded quickly. Startups will lose the hardware battle. For the most part, they do not have the cash to invest into round LEDs, inclusive communication chipsets or exotic materials. Look at  Pebble . The startup luckily got out in front of the giants and courted developers and enthusiasts to its rather simple platform. Compared to the latest smartwatches, the Pebble looks like a Nokia 3310 sitting next to an iPhone. Yet it\u2019s the one I would buy at this point in the game because they\u2019ve proven that they can deliver a solid experience for not very much money. Startups should look at Pebble and follow its lead rather than trying to compete with Samsung or LG on building the best looking hardware. It\u2019s the experience that matters, and the Pebble, with its countless apps, user forums, and rich developer community, is currently the best that\u2019s available. Plus the Pebble Steel is a handsome smartwatch even though it doesn\u2019t have a round faux analog face. Hopefully Pebble doesn\u2019t get buried under a pile of discontinued smartwatches. At this point consumer electronic companies are new to the smartwatch game and do not know what consumers want. Hell, consumers do not know what they want out of a smartwatch yet either. And that\u2019s the trick for Apple. Jony Ive and teams are faced with an impossible task. The industry, consumers, and investors expect Apple to get the smartwatch right the first time. Meanwhile Samsung, LG and the rest will be constantly rolling out new models, getting things wrong, and trying again and again. I can\u2019t tell which strategy is best but I do know these are going to be some confusing times in the smartwatch world.", "tags": "[\"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/smartwatches.jpg?w=738", "title": "Prepare For The Smartwatch Assault"},

He and his partner, Nataly Dawn, are on tour with  Pomplamoose , a band that rivals only OK Go in their dedication to weird and wacky video production and Conte is also co-founder of  Patreon , a way to pay artists for their work. This interview, part of our  back to school  series, is aimed at getting to the bottom of what it means to be a musician in the Internet age and what it takes to be creative in the face of indifference. Conte took a moment out of his touring schedule to offer a few great points for budding online artists. TC: What do student musicians need to know about the market? Conte: Concentrate on making beautiful things. Everything else will follow. Know your goals \u2013 do you want to be an independent musician? Do you want to be rich and famous? Do you want to make a living? Know your goals \u2013 it will help guide your decisions. Think long term. If you sign with a record label, they\u2019ll do everything for you \u2013 which is awesome now. But when you\u2019re 28, you won\u2019t know how to make your own music and run your own business. If the label drops you, you\u2019re toast! Learn every component, every aspect about being a professional creator. Community management is a significant portion of your job. It\u2019s always changing. Read a lot! Keep up with modern tech. It\u2019s a numbers game! If you try ONE thing, it probably won\u2019t work. If you try a thousand things, one thing will probably work. TC: What tools do you need? JC: Unless you\u2019ve given up your business to a record label, there\u2019s no such thing as  just  being a musician anymore. Successful musicians are entrepreneurs \u2013 they work  hard , way beyond 9 to 5. They learn filmmaking and editing software to make their own videos, and they learn audio production software to make their own records. Learn about EQ, compression, and limiting, starting now. It is an art that takes years and years to master. The internet is the greatest textbook ever written. And it\u2019s free. Seriously, read that shit. Get a cheap video camera, a laptop, and a crappy microphone. Start  right now . Stop reading about how to do it, and go do it. Record a song, publish it, and get feedback. Then do that 100 more times. TC: How can you make money? JC: Don\u2019t worry about money. That comes after you have an audience, which comes after you learn how to make beautiful things. In a few years, once you\u2019ve built and audience, read the rest of this paragraph: Since you\u2019re not reading this in 2014 (it\u2019s more like 2018 now, probably), please disregard everything below, as it\u2019s probably no longer relevant. OK fine, maybe a few things are still true: \n\u201cHobby Artists\u201d (people who don\u2019t make a living from their art) have a very idyllic view about art and money. They think artists should never work with brands, that money and art should be separate, that art should live in purity inside a vacuum. That\u2019s why they\u2019re not professional artists. Professional artists constantly live at the intersection of art and money. Making money is half their job. Being a professional artist is 50% making art, 50% building a machine whose input is art and whose output is money. Half your job is to build that machine. It\u2019s different for everyone, it will take a long time. Have low overhead. Be lean. Use what you have. Reuse it. What is the biggest mistake you can make? \nThree things: Underestimating the value of independence /DIY/learning/moving slowly at first. Giving up too early/impatience. Expecting results within 5 years. This is a long fucking haul. You gotta love it\u2026.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/the-movpak-is-an-electric-skateboard-that-folds-into-a-backpack/", "content": "For those with a long commute to work, the hardest part can be the last mile between getting off of the subway or train and walking to the office. The  Movpak  is an electric skateboard built into a full-size backpack, designed to make that final stretch a bit less of a hassle without making you pay for a ride through a car-sharing service. Launching today on Kickstarter , the Movpak doesn\u2019t come cheap: the early-bird special gets you a board from the first production run for $999. After that tier, the price goes up to $1,190 for the first batch, and $1,299 gets you a board from the second run. When the Movpak is available through more traditional retail channels early next year, its creators say the price will go up to $1,999, about the same as  previous electric skateboards originally\u00a0funded through\u00a0Kickstarter. We tested it near\u00a0our offices in San Francisco, and for the most part it made getting around a lot more fun. It has a top speed of 15 miles per hour with a range of 9 miles, more than enough for most walks to work; in fact, it could probably replace a bicycle for commutes of a couple of miles, as long as you\u2019re sure you can find somewhere to plug it in for two hours to top off the battery. While the backpack kind of looks weird sitting at the back of the skateboard, I found that it\u2019s actually really useful as a stabilizer for novice riders. You don\u2019t have to kick to get the Movpack going, as there\u2019s a wireless controller included, so all you have to do is lean slightly into the bag with your rear leg for a smooth ride. While the Movpak is fun when you\u2019re on it, the backpack (which contains the battery) and the skateboard together weigh 17 pounds. In a pinch, it\u2019s convenient to only have to carry one thing (as opposed to having a separate backpack and skateboard), but you wouldn\u2019t want to go hiking with this thing \u2014 except for the fact that the giant battery can be used to charge other devices, like your phone. The backpack has a handle that extends to let you roll the bag around using the skateboard\u2019s wheels, but it kind of detracts from the \u201ccool\u201d factor.", "tags": "[\"Kickstarter\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/movpak.gif?w=640&h=360 https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-02-at-10-40-10-am.png?w=680&h=355", "title": "The Movpak Is An Electric Skateboard That Folds Into A Backpack"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/31/startup-mentors-how-do-you-filter-out-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/", "content": "In light of the recent brouhaha over the  actions of a particular European investor  who had a habit of attaching himself to accelerators as a \u2018mentor\u2019, it seems an appropriate time to do a quick rundown on the kinds of things entrepreneurs need to look for in genuine potential mentor to them and their companies. Because, in case you have been hiding under a rock, there a lot of new \u2019mentors\u2019 flooding towards technology startups, and it would be good if everyone had a clear idea of how this relationship should play out. I asked  on Twitter  and  on Facebook  for some fast feedback on this and got what I think is a pretty representative list of ideas around what due diligence you should do when looking for a mentor for your startup. (Apologies if I don\u2019t name-check everyone who contributed, but to give you a flavour\u2026) Matt Clifford of  Entrepreneur First , thinks there are three main issues.  Firstly, he says, \u201cyou can\u2019t get a (good) mentor by asking someone to be your mentor.\u201d  He says a lot of young entrepreneurs think they need a mentor, so they assume that they should go around asking for on. But, the \u201cbest mentor relationships seem to develop organically. The entrepreneur has a series of interactions with someone and after a while both sides realise they\u2019re getting value from the conversations and \u2013 de facto \u2013 the person has become a mentor.\u201d Secondly, \u201casking good questions is the key to being a good mentee (but is hard work).\u201d A question like \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d is way too vague. You\u2019ll get the most out of mentors when you ask them real, important, very specific questions that provide a lot of context, says Clifford. Thirdly, first-time founders usually \u201cwant the wrong mentors.\u201d First timers picking a \u201ccelebrity mentor\u201d or one who is far, far ahead, is often a bad idea and they are much better off with someone \u201ctwo to five years ahead of them on a similar journey\u201d says Clifford. Most of the day-to-day challenges founders face are highly stage-specific, he says. Is this the right person to help you get your first 1,000 users, for instance? \u201cHire more sales people\u201d is not really an answer, and someone who\u2019s been in that same place very recently is usually better. Startups can of course help themselves by clubbing together and sharing information on mentors. Perhaps write a notional \u201cmentor spec\u201d? But still, the basic questions apply: what they\u2019ve done or achieved besides mentoring and advising. Entrepreneur Ian Broom tells me: \u201cI get mentors to agree a contract, like a staff member, and set expectations. Especially if you\u2019re offering equity, it\u2019s crucial the mentor vests like everyone else.\u201d James Bromley of  Swiftkey  adds that you should ask for references. And are they \u201cground level practical\u201d? Also check if the mentor is a frequent \u2018conference bore\u2019, rather than actually working. Matthias Metternich of  Believe.in  says you should check out the prospective mentor\u2019s network and whether they\u2019d be open to making relevant introductions to others. He also advises getting mentors who fulfil functional roles and who can go deep. \u201cWe have separate mentors for mobile, bus dev, branding, marketing, hiring, etc\u201d Mentors who are still \u201cdoers\u201d are more valuable.  And keep them in the loop: \u201cNo one can mentor well without understanding what\u2019s up \u2013 it\u2019s a two-way street,\u201d points out Metternich . Russell Buckley, formerly of Admob now partner of  Ballpark Ventures , says you shouldn\u2019t over-pay mentors and Non-Execs, and  wrote about here .  He agrees that vesting options along with other staff members means \u201cyou can fire people who don\u2019t deliver to the stated expectations.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m also encouraging some of the companies I work with to set OKRs or KPIs (depending on the tools they use) for their Board and advisors. Not a popular idea with many Directors, but I would like to see it as normal. After all, most investor/directors sell themselves as adding value prior to the investment, so why not hold them accountable?\u201d Use tools to check out a mentor\u2019s credentials and investments such as Companies House /  http://duedil.com And looking through their AngelList, LinkedIn  and Twitter / social profiles etc is an obvious move but sometimes forgotten. Eileen Tso Burbidge of  Passion Capital  says if the mentor has written catchy blog posts that can even qualify as usefulness as a mentor. Then there is Jason Lemkin\u2019s  2.5x rule  which is: \u201cAfter 2 1/2 meetings, after 2 1/2 intros to VCs or potential VP hires, after 2 1/2 times they \u201chelp\u201d \u2026 you need to \u201cpay\u201d or they go away.  Until then, you don\u2019t have to pay.

That is much harder to get when just one side reaches out.\u201d He says it comes together roost naturally when his mentorships have \u201cstarted from accelerators or classes I\u2019ve taught.\u201d He notes a drawback: many teams are either not ready to listen or not at the right stage to actually action some mentors\u2019 most valuable advice when one side or the other reaches out. \u201cOf course, when the timing is right, both sides learn and gain a lot.\u201d But how do you avoid bad mentors?

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/heres-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-celebrity-photo-hack/", "content": "UPDATE : Clearly this post was written very early on in this incident and information has since come to light which  suggests Apple has majorly dropped the ball . Original post: As you will  by now have probably read , around 100 women celebrities (including Jennifer Lawrence, Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice and Kate Upton) have had naked and explicit pictures seemingly hacked from their iCloud accounts and published online, first on 4Chan and now all over the place. As a reminder, iCloud automatically stores photos, email, contacts and other information online, allowing users to sync this data across different devices. Many of the photos have been confirmed as being genuine, most notably by Lawrence. The anonymous hacker who originally posted the images first on  4Chan  claimed they were taken from iCloud accounts. They demanded donations via PayPal and Bitcoin in exchange for posting them, but only received 0.2545 BTC in donations, which is verifiable at this address: 18pgUn3BBBdnQjKG8ZGedFvcoVcsv1knWa While it\u2019s highly unlikely to be a security issue with iCloud, the incident has served to remind us all of the issues around internet security in general. So what do we know about the celebrity photo hacks? THE MEDIA \nThe mainstream media is reporting the phones were \u201chacked\u201d. As usually, this is rarely defined. Lawrence has previously said she uses iCloud,  once saying : \u201cMy iCloud keeps telling me to back it up, and I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t know how to back you up. Do it yourself.\u201d Metadata in the images shows that the vast majority were taken using Apple devices. THE \u2018HACK\u2019 \nThere is a suggestion that iCloud  has been \u201chacked\u201d . There has been absolutely no confirmation of this from Apple. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the \u201chacker\u201d (or it may have been a group of hackers) was not able to breach Apple\u2019s security in general, but instead targeted specific victims using a combination of social engineering, cracking the password or using Apple\u2019s \u201cForgot my password\u201d route. They could also have used other less technical methods (it\u2019s usually the non-tech method that turn out to be the culprit, btw). GUESSING EMAIL ADDRESSES AND PASSWORDS \nJennifer Lawrence was once quoted in a Time article about her email address containing a key word. Not a wise move. Never give clues in the public domain. Once an email address is known, a hacker could email the target person purporting to be something else (Apple\u2019s iTunes for instance). The target puts their email and password into the hacker\u2019s fake page. Voila.  This phishing attack is  emerging as a likely culprit . Also, having the same password for multiple products (such as eBay and Amazon) means a hacker, if they can get one account right, could use the same password to access your email or iCloud. Also, Apple\u2019s \u201cForgot my password\u201d system means that if you know the victim\u2019s birthday and the answers to some security questions, you might gain access to their account. There is a LOT of information out there on celebrities, so coming up with ideas for passwords is entirely possible. Once inside it\u2019s not possible to see photos or videos which are automatically uploaded from your iPhone to iCloud but you can use software to download it all. Again, voila. iCLOUD\u2019S SAFETY MECHANISM To gain access to Photostream, you would need to login with the iCloud user name on a new OSX or iOS machine. If you do that, iCloud sends you an e-mail that a new machine has logged in. You also get a notification on all the other machines using your iCloud account (iPhone, iPad, Mac) telling you a new machine is logged in. So, basically, when you get both mails and notifications, the normal reaction would be to realise you were being hacked and to change your password immediately. Since the notification is almost instant, changing the password very quickly would mean Photostream wouldn\u2019t be able to sync to the Hacker\u2019s machine fast enough for it to download 30 days of photos.  This is one of the main reasons why most experts don\u2019t suspect this incident to be a hack of iCloud. A PROPER HACK \nAnother method might be a \u2018brute force attack\u2019 on an iCloud account via an automated program. This is hard on iCloud, though theoretically possible. The Next Web  suggests  that a Python script on Github (and shared on Hacker News) recently allowed malicious users to \u2018brute force\u2019 a target account\u2019s password on Apple\u2019s iCloud, thanks to a vulnerability in the Find my iPhone service. Apple  appears to have already patched the hole, however . There\u2019s no official confirmation this is the culprit though. WAS IT VIA ANOTHER SERVICE? \nSince many of the images appear to have been taken with Android devices and webcams, the leaked images may not have originated from the iCloud photo backup service at all. Many services have automatic backup tools, and could be accessed in similar ways to iCloud (as above). SNAPCHAT? \nSome of the photos had text overlaid. Were they from Snapchat? Probably not. These are most likely screen shots on someone\u2019s phone. VIA Wi-Fi? \nWere phones hacked via WiFi, perhaps at a celebrity event? This is also not known or confirmed. AN INSIDER? \nPersonal assistants and bodyguards often have access to celebrity phones. It\u2019s a possibility. Was this hack an employee with access to data somewhere? Again, there\u2019s on confirmation of this (and no suggestion it happened). A STOLEN DEVICE? \nThere is aways the physical theft of a phone or laptop of a celebrity or belonging to someone well-connected to celebrities. SHOULD YOU BE WORRIED? \nNo. iCloud is almost certainly safe. This looks like targeted attacks on well-known and \u2018high value\u2019 celebrities using some of the above methods.  UPDATE : Clearly this post was written very early on in this incident and information has since come to light which  suggests Apple has majorly dropped the ball . HOW TO BETTER PROTECT YOURSELF \nThe best way is to turn on two-step (or \u2018two factor\u2019) verification for your iCloud account (or any online account), meaning a hacker would also need physical access to your phone AND your phone\u2019s password to get in, via a text message sent to your phone with a temporary PIN. All the other services, like Google, also have two-step authentication. Check out  TwoFactorAuth.org Make your security questions more complex (e.g. not your date of birth, your pet\u2019s name etc). \u2018qwerty\u2019 or \u2018123456\u2019 are the dumbest passwords ever. Still really, really, really worried? Then completely turn off iCloud photo syncing through Settings > iCloud. Or any similar automatic backup service. Then the photos will only ever be on your phone or the computer you back them up to. Then you have to worry about the phone or laptop being stolen and losing your photos\u2026 BE CAREFUL OUT THERE This is not the first time private celebrity images have been compromised. In 2011 many celebrities had images compromised by  hacker Christopher Chaney  who got into email accounts simply by guessing passwords. Chaney was caught and sentenced to 10 years in prison. But guys like that are rarely caught. So use better security for your personal stuff. And remember: Taking naked photos of yourself  is not a crime and you have nothing to apologise for . It\u2019s the hacker in all these kinds of cases that is the criminal.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/the-case-for-intelligent-failure-to-invent-the-future/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:   Vinod Khosla is the founder of  Khosla Ventures . The world is changing at an increasingly rapid pace. In the past, experts with spreadsheets and econometric models or social scientists with subscale studies and linear models may have been useful. These so-called experts extrapolated from what came before, but as the rate of change has increased, looking to the past often is no longer meaningful \u2013 especially in a world driven by new technology. In 1986, the McKinsey consulting group was asked to forecast the number of cell phones that would be in use in the United States by the year 2000; their model predicted fewer than one million, but the actual figure was more than two orders of magnitude greater at 109 million. How could one predict in 1986 what technology would look like by 2000? Today, the means of production and distribution are being democratized and technology\u2019s ability to enable creative uses and business models is quickly evolving. One person can spread an idea to billions. One person can build a product used by billions. The future will not be like the past. The future will be built by those who will take risks and action to invent the world they want. Our civilization\u2019s needs are expanding rapidly, as seven billion people reach for the lifestyle of the 700 million most well off while our physical resources cannot keep pace. The only way to bridge the gap is with intellectual capital, which will multiply the resources available to us. When five-to-seven billion people all demand equal energy consumption per capita, natural resources per capita (lumber, copper, steel, etc.), medical, health and educational resources and resource-intensive foods (meat, poultry, sugars, etc.); the way out is not linear scaling but rather resource multiplication through innovative technology. Already, Wikipedia is the most powerful medical tool we have globally today; Google the most powerful learning tool; Facebook and Twitter the most powerful social tools. It is an absolute necessity that we develop intellectual property that multiplies our resources if we are to bridge this gap.\u00a0We must invent our way into a new future. There is many an entrepreneur toiling away in anonymity, working on things few others know is important, but some of them will change the world. Over the years, I have developed great skepticism toward so-called experts and pontificators who seem authoritative in forecasting and create an illusion of knowing based on very little actual expertise. For instance, a University of California study conducted over the course of twenty years polled 284 eminent experts \u2013 ranging from politicians to professors and correspondents to consultants \u2013 all with widely differing opinions from\u00a0 Marxists \u00a0to\u00a0 free-marketers . The so-called \u201cexperts\u201d made 28,000\u00a0 predictions \u00a0about the future, but  researchers  found they were only slightly more accurate than chance and worse than basic\u00a0computer algorithms. Most planning and reliance on traditional methods and processes lead to similar errors all while giving people false confidence, especially as the rate of change accelerates. Academics, especially in the social sciences, don\u2019t do much better. On the other hand, I have experienced the power of doers, the chaotic and na\u00efve world of optimistic entrepreneurs who just try things, admit mistakes, fail, learn, iterate, try again and find solutions \u2013 often out of necessity. Accepting, even encouraging, the right kind of failure is the best way to discover the solution to our problems and close the resource gap. Learning by engaging, iterating and persisting, rather than pursuing academic studies or writing papers, seem to be the major drivers of change (although I also am a fan of scholarship to expand human knowledge that in some cases entrepreneurs may apply or leverage). In bridging the gap between the resources we have and the resources and progress we want, the biggest risk we can take is to not take any risks at all. Taking risks means accepting failure and also recognizing that not all failure is good. Failure because of intelligent but risky attempts may be the only way we bridge this gap. As Robert F. Kennedy so aptly put it, \u201cOnly those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.\u201d Many smart people have taken big risks and made intelligent attempts at audacious goals but still failed. Sometimes the failure is because they pursued the wrong vision. Sometimes the vision is right but the tactics are wrong. Often, the failure can be simply attributed to just plain bad luck. There are a dozen reasons a good venture can fail. In my decades of encouraging entrepreneurs and innovation, I have learned that an entrepreneur probably only controls approximately 30 to 40-percent of the factors that affect their success. Competitors and environmental circumstances often make up the rest. This doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t try, because if we didn\u2019t then the world would approach stasis. If we take the very small percentage of entrepreneurs who succeed (keeping in mind that early in their careers, it\u2019s hard to differentiate the successful entrepreneurs from the failures) and look at the impact they have made and the resources they have helped multiply, the failures seem trivial by comparison. A 90-percent probability of failure means a 10-percent chance of changing the world, if the goal is ambitious enough. We may have lost resources in those failed efforts, and naive journalists may have poked fun at them, but without the attempts, we would not eventually have developed the many innovations that revolutionize how we live today \u2013 including the personal computer, email, the Internet, the mobile phone, the tablet or any of the endless applications built on these technologies. We would not have Google, Twitter, Amazon, Uber or countless others. Although a hundred entrepreneurs may fail for each one that succeeds, the successes make the failures worthwhile. Too often, there is a tendency, especially among investors, large corporations, and public officials, to reduce the probability of failure to the point that the consequences of success become inconsequential. In the area of sustainable energy, only cost effective and clean solutions matter, and those are likely to come from entrepreneurs attempting Black Swan technologies or approaches that few believe are possible. Already, Tesla has changed the automaker\u2019s view of electric cars, and Google\u2019s driverless car effort has gotten others moving on self-driving cars. In the areas of agriculture and food, we are seeing early attempts at unconventional approaches and innovation to upend the current resource inefficient system. In education, the old guard laughs at early failures in online learning and massive open online courses (MOOCs) considering them naive, but entrepreneurs are now trying the next iteration after learning from their mistakes (even though many academic pontificators dismiss this education style entirely). Beyond the litany of information technology pioneers, the efforts of innovators in other fields have been equally impressive in forcing change in their respective fields. Entrepreneurs at Genentech in the 1980s revolutionized pharmaceutical drug discovery. Horizontal drilling caused a big, but questionable, shift in energy production, which affected natural gas prices and home heating bills. Entrepreneurship itself is not a complete solution as social and political factors often play a part, but it is still the single most important resource multiplier we have. In fact, entrepreneurship, especially technology-based entrepreneurship, may be the only necessary, if not sufficient, response to meet the global population\u2019s desires for a better life and to give seven billion people the resource rich lifestyle that approximately seven hundred million of us currently enjoy. George Bernard Shaw famously said, \u201cThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\u201d It is encouraging to see entrepreneurs fighting to overcome the naysayers who pervade our world. It is energizing to feel the passion that entrepreneurs with a dream bring to their industry. Skeptics and cynics never did the impossible, and we need the impossible to bridge our resource gap. Please don\u2019t call a committee hearing or start a research study to follow up on this idea. Just go do it.", "tags": "[\"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/vetruvian-split.jpg?w=738", "title": "The Case For Intelligent Failure To Invent The Future"},

This Cloud has no politics about where it goes. Sometimes it\u2019s has issues here and there. But it just keeps rolling. And the latest country the Internet startup economy is emerging is: Iran.  Now  Techly.co , a new TechCrunch-esque blog written entirely in English, has launched to try and rally the country\u2019s nascent tech scene. Techly.co was started by  Nasser Ghanemzadeh  and  Mobin Ranjbar . The founder and CEO at  Opatan , the first, and possibly the only, Iranian Cloud Startup, Ghanemzadeh  is also co-founder of the  Iran Startups  startup community site. Ghanemzadeh has also helped organise the Lean Startup Machine Tehran and several Startup Weekends. Ranjbar, while acting as Editor in Chief of Techly.co, is also the founder of  Shariksho , the first co-working space in Iran. \u201cAs you know Iran right now is a \u2018black box\u2019 for most people outside it. We hope to open up the scene here and cover Iranian startup and tech news,\u201d Ghanemzadeh told me, speaking from Tehran. \u201cWe have more 100 startups all growing fast. Every week a new startup is born.\u201d The ecosystem is of course young. Perhaps the biggest Startup there,  Digikala  is an ecommerce site along the lines of Amazon, reportedly  worth $150m already . According to Ghanemzadeh, there are a handful of emerging VCs in the country including  Simorgh ,  Shenasa Sarava ,  Sharif VC  and one called  MAPS , which has just launched. Accelerators include  DMOND Group  (a brand of Plug & Play) and  Avatech . Two other teams are working to start Accelerators, including Ghanemzadeh, and there are many old-school Incubators. Currently Iran Startups has  monthly meetings , and does several other  activities  to boost the Iranian startup ecosystem.  Iran Startups even have T-Shirts. The above was  a present to Roxanne Varza , an ethnic Iranian based in Paris with Microsoft\u2019s Accelerator, who recently met with the scene there (mine is poised to be revealed).

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/05/apple-dominating-shipping-capacity-out-of-china-with-new-iphones/", "content": "According to several sources, Apple has already begun flexing its supply chain muscles by shipping so many units of upcoming devices from its manufacturing facilities to sales outlets that it is causing delays for other manufacturers. Apple shipments via major concerns like FedEx and UPS are said to be \u2018incredibly high\u2019 for the holiday quarter, pointing to a massive number of iPhones and whatever other units\u00a0Apple announces for the fall season incoming. The company is apparently flooding its channels with devices, causing shipments for other \u2018top tier\u2019 device makers to be delayed to make way for Apple products. One other\u00a0manufacturer was reportedly told by shippers that they couldn\u2019t meet some deadlines because they were booked up servicing a \u2018very important customer\u2019. If Apple is displacing shipments from other manufacturers with its volume then it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. An account given by logistics exec  John Martin to Businessweek  a couple of years ago gives a few examples: \u201cApple began innovating on the nitty-gritty details of supply-chain management almost immediately upon Steve Jobs\u2019s return in 1997. At the time, most computer manufacturers transported products by sea, a far cheaper option than air freight. To ensure that the company\u2019s new, translucent blue iMacs would be widely available at Christmas the following year, Jobs paid $50 million to buy up all the available holiday air freight space, says John Martin, a logistics executive who worked with Jobs to arrange the flights. The move handicapped rivals such as Compaq that later wanted to book air transport. Similarly, when iPod sales took off in 2001, Apple realized it could pack so many of the diminutive music players on planes that it became economical to ship them directly from Chinese factories to consumers\u2019 doors. When an HP staffer bought one and received it a few days later, tracking its progress around the world through Apple\u2019s website, \u201cIt was an \u2018Oh s\u2014\u2019 moment,\u201d recalls [former HP supply chain chief Mike] Fawkes.\u201d It also points to Apple\u2019s hopes to sell an enormous number of devices in the holiday quarter. Reportedly, those include  at least one new iPhone and updates to the iPad  \u2014 a rumored wearable device is reported to be announced but  shipped next year . Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin  estimates  (subscription required) that \u2014 provided it can make enough of them \u2014 Apple could sell in the mid-60 million iPhones in the holiday quarter. \u201cThe other thing that will be interesting to watch is what happens with Samsung\u2019s sales. Last quarter, Samsung shipped 78m smartphones and they stuffed the channel prematurely to mask some of their challenges,\u201d says Bajarin. \u201cI think it is extremely possible, given the sense I get on both Apple and Samsung trend lines, that Apple and Samsung sales in the holiday quarter could be closer than people think.\u201d Samsung having pushed a lot of phones last quarter to cover up  some of its\u00a0sales slump issues  could bite it\u00a0in the butt\u00a0if Apple eats up shipping capacity in a way that makes it tough for the company to get the new Galaxy models into the country.", "tags": "[\"iPhone 6\", \"iPhone\", \"Apple\", \"Samsung\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/apple-iphone-621-1.jpg?w=700", "title": "Apple Dominating Shipping Capacity Out Of China With New iPhones"},

Another source says this number is actually 27, including several execs, PR and tech staff. Nasty Gal laid off another four employees in its Kentucky-based fulfillment center last week, as well, according to an anonymous tip. Nasty Gal employed about 280 people at the end of 2013 so these layoffs account for over 10 percent of staff cuts. As one\u00a0source tells it, \u201cNasty Gal is in the middle of a massive reorganization and has hired several high level employees but has decided to let go of 27 employees today.\u201d We reached out to Amoruso as well as her PR team for a response. Neither have responded but a spokesperson outside of the company confirmed in a phone conversation that the company was low on PR staff at the moment and she was helping out in the interim. In addition to the layoffs, there are indications that the company has other issues.\u00a0Just 38 percent of employees approve of the CEO on its  Glassdoor  page and only 30 percent of employees would recommend a friend work for the company. One former employee\u2019s review of the company includes pros like snacks and lots of parties. The cons seem to paint the company as not rewarding talent: I have never been around so many talented, inspiring people who are held back and disrespected. Success is measured by not only the amount of money a company makes, but the type of culture it maintains and reputation it creates. To hear from people who still work there, that they hate going to work, they are undermined constantly and as a result are disconnected from the brand is truly sad. Nasty Gal had so much potential to be a great brand, but kinda blew it. Not only losing great employees who built the brand, but lots of customers along the way. Another former employee gave the company just two stars on Glassdoor and said the company had spent too much money on things like decor instead of salaries. The reviews have other uncomplimentary\u00a0\u00a0things to say about a lack of company vision, poor follow through\u00a0and leadership. We\u2019ll let you know if the company or CEO does get back to us about the company layoffs or employee culture.

We are building a \npowerful brand that leads the market and are committed to creating \nsomething that has never been created before. We are excited to open \nour first two stores in the near future and continue to build the team \nto support that growth. Part of these changes were to work exclusively with agencies on the PR \nside, which we have done in the past and we know performs for the \nbusiness. Our Technology team was affected as well.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/06/apple-iphone-6-event-predictions/", "content": "Apple is hosting an event on September 9, and by all accounts it\u2019s going to be a real barn burner. The company is set to announce new iPhones, and this much you can take to the bank, but rumors have also arisen suggesting we\u2019ll see a brand new wearable device of some kind \u2013 the great and powerful \u2018iWatch\u2019 of legend. Apple will also probably showcase iOS 8, along with more details about features like HomeKit and Health/HealthKit that will probably be easier to demo now that developers have had time to build for them. Murmurs also say we\u2019ll finally see Apple pull back the curtain on its long-rumored mobile payments play, and that launch could very well set the commerce world on its head. The next iPhone is almost certainly going to bring a larger display to Apple\u2019s signature device, and most rumors agree that it will offer up both a  4.7-inch and 5.5-inch option . This will be a marked difference from the existing iPhone, given that Apple has remained committed to a 4-inch diagonal since introducing it on the iPhone 5 two years ago, at which point even that was a big step up from the 3.5-inch screen on all previous iPhone devices. In addition to a larger screen, expect Apple to introduce a  new case design , one that features softer edges when compared to the current look. Leaks and mock-ups based on supposed components from suppliers suggest it\u2019ll have a lot in common with the design language Apple first introduced with the iPad mini, which then made its way into last year\u2019s iPad Air. Most expect a thinner chassis as well, along with the new rounded corners. Touch ID will almost certainly reprise its role as Apple\u2019s fancy fingerprint unlocked, especially given Apple\u2019s decision to open up access to the tool to third-party developers and apps. It could feature prominently in Apple\u2019s mobile payments plans, too, as an additional authentication layer.  NFC, too, is something Apple is said to finally be embracing , also owing to how it can help its mobile payments efforts, and potentially for easier pairing between the new iPhone and its brand new mystery wearable. New materials used in the iPhone\u2019s construction should include a strong sapphire-based composite of some kind that offers additional projection against scratching and breaking.  Apple has a large-scale partnership with GT Advanced Technologies , a manufacturer that specializes in sapphire production, and indications are that we\u2019ll see this bear fruit, though some reports claim that this new tech might only be used in higher-end models of the iPhone, with standard reinforced glass used on less expensive versions. Finally, expect the usual spate of internal hardware improvements, including a more capable camera, better network connectivity (802.11ac Wi-Fi and LTE-Advanced are reasonable expectations), a boosted processor (A8 generation of Apple\u2019s in-house system-on-a-chip) and more. While at this point it seems unlikely Apple will actually call its wearable the \u2018iWatch,\u2019 it\u2019s still a useful portmanteau for whatever wrist-worn device Apple does launch. Rumors suggest we\u2019ll see some kind of  fitness tracking, heart rate sensing, notification delivering smartwatch and activity tracker  combo, and recent reports indicate that it could feature NFC and figure prominently in Apple\u2019s mobile payment plans. In terms of detailed specs, so far we\u2019ve heard precious little and seen nothing in terms of reputable parts leaks from the supply chain. The WSJ and NYT both agree that we\u2019re probably going to get two sizes of screen, with both a  1.4-inch and 1.7-inch version . That screen will be made of a flexible, OLED material that curves around the wrist, say these same sources, and will be rectangular in shape. Apple\u2019s iWatch has to offer something more than the basic feature set included in existing smartwatches like Pebble and Android Wear hardware, since neither has excited consumers in a way that makes the things fly off the shelves. If Apple wants to mainstream the wearable, it needs to impress out of the gate, and that could be part of the reason rumors say it won\u2019t actually ship the device until early next year, despite an initial reveal next week. That would give software developers the time to build solid experiences for the platform, and it gives Apple more leeway in terms of ramping up production. We know that iOS 8 will arrive, and Apple has already revealed much of what the new software update will contain, including support for third-party keyboards, a new Health app and HealthKit APIs for developers, plus the HomeKit connected home software tools. Apple has revamped its own keyboard, too, and built-in automatic typing suggestions, plus new Messages and Photos experiences. Multitasking now provides recent contacts for quick access, you can share iTunes accounts with your family, and iCloud drive makes it easier to use iCloud for cross-platform document storage and retrieval. Apple has already launched a  consumer preview of OS X Yosemite , which shows off Continuity and its new Handoff features that let users start actions like composing emails or browsing the web on one device, and pick them up on another, but with the actual launch of iOS 8 we should get a better look at how those work. We\u2019ll also finally see how it handles transferring non-iMessage texts and non-Facebook phone calls to your desktop, since there\u2019s no media gag on the Yosemite preview this time around. Most interesting will be seeing what Apple does with HealthKit, HomeKit and its  mobile payments play . We\u2019ll finally see what these aspects of its software, which are basically empty vessels, can do when filled with content from developers. Will Apple make iOS a full-featured hub for health and medical records? It is reportedly working with healthcare providers, but on Tuesday we should get an idea of how deeply these partnerships run. Expect consumer availability to follow the Tuesday event closely, with availability either the same day or within a week\u2019s time. We\u2019ve heard just a little about this possibility, so don\u2019t count on it, but KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there will be an  iPad Air 2 announcement at this same event , instead of at a separate one in October, when Apple revealed new iPads last year. The new iPad Air might then be a fairly minor update on the version introduced in 2013, possibly with the addition of Touch ID, and maybe with some additional against in terms of thinning the device case. This one isn\u2019t in the bag, but if Apple is focused on the rest of the line for updates this year, it could roll iPad announcements into this event. That would still leave October primed for new Mac announcements. OS X has an update imminent, as is obvious from the Yosemite preview and continuing beta updates, but it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see it launched for the public at the event, despite the Continuity features that tie into iOS 8. Apple would be hard-pressed to ship two such major software updates at the same time, and so much change across their device ecosystem is also a lot to handle for consumers. The availability of the consumer preview of Yosemite means that there\u2019s less impetus on getting it out the door in sync with iOS 8, since Continuity can be shown off in other ways to whet user appetite for a later launch. I\u2019d also expect Apple to hold any new OS X launch until it plans on shipping new Macs, and it makes more sense for Apple to wait until October to do that, rather than adding yet another hardware announcement to its full slate for next week. Apple\u2019s event on Tuesday is going to be just packed to the gills with announcements, no matter how much of the above comes true. New iPhones alone would be plenty to crow about, but we\u2019ll almost certainly also finally see Cupertino\u2019s wearable tech play unveiled, and given all the question marks there, that may be an even more exciting reveal.", "tags": "[\"iPhone 6\", \"event\", \"Apple\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/iphone-event.png?w=727 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/apple-iphone-621-1.jpg?w=700&h=511 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/iphone-5s-fingerprint-sensor.png?w=1024&h=683 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/iwatch.jpg?w=1024&h=720 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ios8_topic.png?w=600&h=600 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/os-x-yosemite.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "title": "What To Expect From Apple\u2019s iPhone Event On September 9"},

A car and nowhere to go? Drive for Uber or Lyft! The taxi industry is a regulatory-capture nightmare. Disrupt \u2018em \u2019til they\u2019re dead? Don\u2019t mind if you do! \u2026And yet our 21st-century sharing-economy dream is beginning to look worryingly like a 19th-century robber-baron nightmare. When sharing-economy gigs supplement your income from your job, that\u2019s great, everybody wins. But when sharing-economy gigs  are  your job? That\u2019s different. As the  New York Times   puts it , sharing-economy workers: are less microentrepreneurs than microearners. They often work seven-day weeks, trying to assemble a living wage from a series of one-off gigs [...] With piecemeal gigs easier to obtain than long-term employment, a new class of laborer, dependent on precarious work and wages, is emerging. Re -emerging is probably a better word. In the early 20th century, the labor movement won workers  eight-hour days , weekends, paid time off, etc. Before then, most labored like  serfs , working long hours all week with no job security, no benefits, no vacations, no real prospect of advancement\u2026 \u2026in other words, exactly what you get today when you work at sharing-economy gigs, rather than at, you know, a job. Not that technology is necessarily making those easier either. Another recent  NYT  piece  reports  on scheduling algorithms, which, in the language of Silicon Valley, are \u2018 redefining workforce optimization through big data .\u2019 But on the ground, this: pits sophisticated workplace technology against some fundamental requirements of parenting, with particularly harsh consequences for poor single mothers [...]  Flexibility \u2014 an alluring word for white-collar workers \u2014 can have a darker meaning for many low-income workers as a euphemism for unstable hours or paychecks Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m an engineer. I love efficiency and optimization. But it\u2019s hard to simultaneously optimize for both profits and people. Let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that algorithms which boost the former often tend to be pretty hard on the latter. Similarly, I\u2019m a big fan and frequent user of Uber, TaskRabbit, and Instacart. I think it\u2019s great that people can supplement their income that way. But at the same time, as I\u2019ve  put it before :  \u201csharing economy\u201d is mostly spin. It mostly consists of people who have excess disposable income hiring those who do not.  It\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that, as in the 19th century, the world of work is dividing ever further between haves and have-nots\u2013sharing-economy customers, and sharing-economy providers. For haves like us,  everything is awesome . And if things are rough for the have-nots, hey, that\u2019s not  technology\u2019s  fault, right? That\u2019s a simple side effect of supply and demand, combined with, you know, healthy competition. The sharing economy is some cutthroat shit:   theverge.com/2014/8/26/6067\u2026 \u2014  Craig Silverman (@CraigSilverman)  August 26, 2014 True, Uber and Lyft are in land-grab mode right now, and drivers are reaping the benefits. But land grabs don\u2019t last forever, and there\u2019s a glut of labor out there. \u201c In July, 9.7 million Americans were unemployed, and an additional 7.5 million were working part-time jobs because they could not find full-time work. \u201d Once the land grabs are over, most gig workers will be trivially replaceable, or even entirely  disposable \u2013and will suffer the consequences. As Danny Crichton  points out , the sharing economy and its algorithms can, in principle, have real benefits for its providers, too: workers have the ability to develop their own personalities and brands \u2026 startup labor marketplaces are including computational trust and reputation systems from the beginning, ensuring that employers and employees have an incentive to work together and share credit. This isn\u2019t an entirely unmixed blessing\u2013I\u2019ve seen TaskRabbits sacrifice income in favor of reputation, and I suspect many customers use that tradeoff as leverage to pay them less\u2013but on the whole it\u2019s a good thing. Unfortunately those benefits pale and wither before the inexorable law of supply and demand. If there are too many providers and not enough consumers, too many have-nots and not enough haves, then most people who work in the burgeoning sharing economy are screwed. No scheduling algorithm or reputation system will solve that problem. So the real question remains: is technology  destroying jobs  faster than it\u2019s  creating them ? Are we moving from a  Mediocristan  world, wherein most people contribute a little, to  Extremistan , wherein an ever-diminishing minority uses the lever of ever-improving technology to move the world to their liking, while more and more are excluded from  jobs  and must fight and scrap to get by with endless dead-end, barely-livable  gigs ? That is one of this decade\u2019s most important questions, and if the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d then the sharing economy is no solution. It\u2019s barely even a band-aid.

As a venture investor looking to invest in data-driven companies, telling real data science apart from pseudo science is difficult, but it\u2019s critically important. Investing in a data science application company won\u2019t deliver long-term returns if the company uses quackery. Real data science involves using complex algorithms to collect masses of data, analyze all of it, and convert it into real answers. There\u2019s a lot of pseudo data science being peddled by software companies that claim they can turn data into gold. While these alchemists dangle buzzwords like \u201cbig data\u201d and \u201cmachine learning,\u201d they really aren\u2019t doing any data science; they\u2019re just querying subsets of data to deliver limited findings. So what is real data science and how can you spot software companies that are really using it to deliver meaningful business insights?\u00a0Here are three ways to tell if the software company you\u2019re considering funding uses real data science. The first level of distinction between real and pseudo data science involves the difference between a query and an algorithm. Data science uses algorithms to collect and analyze up to thousands, millions, or billions of rows of columns, automatically discovering new relationships in data. Then, these algorithms learn and adapt, getting more and more accurate over time to spot current and future trends \u2013 otherwise known as \u201cmachine learning.\u201d Using real data science, a predictive analytics to solution might discover, on its own, the top reasons why sales deals go south; a BI tool might take the information the algorithm generates and create a rendered report or workbook showing action-oriented tasks. Algorithms continually adapt and change as they process new data and glean new learnings. On the other hand, queries are simply one-time questions and they never learn from themselves. A database query, however complex, is not data science. A query asks a single question such as \u201csum sales by territory\u201d but doesn\u2019t provide any actionable insights. The second level of distinction between real and pseudo data science concerns the notion of \u201cmodel richness\u201d used to create and understand predictive models. To understand this distinction, let\u2019s review what a \u201cpredictive model\u201d is. In the case of predicting whether a sales deal will close or not, for example, a predictive model needs data from which to construct a complex model and then make a prediction. This data can come from CRM applications like Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics, which were designed, up to a point, to capture the dynamic and complex nature of a sales process. Imagine the tortuous steps in takes to sell an American-made plane to an airline in a foreign country. It\u2019s tough, complicated, and takes a long time. But here\u2019s the catch. Salesforce, for example, doesn\u2019t keep a history of a deal for more than 90 days. So in order to understand everything that went into a deal, you have to use data science to gather various data from myriad sources to create a \u201crich model.\u201d Taking the sales data scenario a step further, the fake data scientists don\u2019t have rich data sets, so they provide only a slim view of a deal \u2013 basically, whether a deal was \u201cwon\u201d or \u201clost.\u201d In contrast, real data science would use a rich data model based on a comprehensive, relevant data set to provide accurate, actionable and highly valuable insights. Data science uses \u201ctemporal\u201d technology to analyze every aspect of the sales process, and in so doing, can characterize a winning versus losing sales cycle. Rich data sets are hard to come by. Only a few predictive analytics companies have access to data sets large enough to enable scientists to score them to provide not just answers, but accurate predictions about potential future outcomes. Many software companies try to get around having rich data sets by claiming they use more signals than anybody else. A signal is a single data point, for example from a government database on education. Some companies engage in \u201csignal spin,\u201d counting every column of data sources they could potentially use (but usually don\u2019t) to increase their signal count. To distinguish the heavyweights from lightweights, you have to have a data scientist dig deeper and start reviewing confusion matrices and F1 scores. A simpler way to tell when a company is engaging in signal spin is by asking a single question: What are the top 10 attributes considered in your algorithm? Lightweights can\u2019t typically get past No. 3, let alone 4,000. The bottom line:\u00a0Don\u2019t let the quantity of signals mask the quality required to develop accurate and rich models. In most cases, the signals cited aren\u2019t even used. Telling real data science apart from pseudo science isn\u2019t easy. But if you\u2019re considering investing in a software company that claims to use real data science, just ask them these three crucial questions to find out if they\u2019re real scientists or quacks. Pseudo science, like alchemy, may look good on the surface, but dig a bit deeper, and its fake claims are simply too good to be true.\u00a0Don\u2019t get stuck with lead and alchemy when the only thing that will deliver long-term financial gains is real data science.", "tags": "[\"data science\", \"big data\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/shutterstock_133618061-e1409778129235.jpg?w=738", "title": "Three Marks Of Real Data Science"},

Eshel and Shalev are based in Battery\u2019s Israel office, while Moore works from Menlo Park. For a full list of Battery\u2019s portfolio investments, please click  here . Cyber attacks are all over the news, and it seems like no one is immune \u2014  Home Depot ,  Target , Adobe and  eBay  included. So why are CIOs still fighting cyber criminals with one hand tied behind their backs? Shockingly, most companies are still relying on outdated, only partially effective methods to protect their sensitive data, mainly with technology that focuses on preventing incoming attacks. But actually stopping bad guys from slipping inside enterprise networks and getting their hands on sensitive data is nearly impossible these days. In fact, among organizations with over 5,000 computers, over 90 percent have an active breach of some sort at any given time. What\u2019s worse, those organizations may not even know about it. It\u2019s time for CIOs to start focusing on the next line of defense in the war against cyber crime: an emerging area called breach detection, which focuses on identifying long-tail intrusions after they happen and mitigating their damage, partly through the use of big-data technologies. Your company\u2019s information security may depend on it. Surviving a shark attack is fairly simple: As long as you swim faster than the person next to you, chances are you\u2019ll make it. Not so long ago, security was very much the same. As long as your company had better-than-average security, you were likely safe because someone else would get hit first. Hackers were looking for the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d \u2014 the easy breaches. Online criminals mainly used a broad \u201cspray and pray\u201d approach to opportunistically find targets. In those days, \u201csignature-based\u201d security solutions, which tried to identify known, malicious code patterns and block them, made sense. If one company saw a new threat, a signature could be written for it and distributed to others to protect them from infection. Fast forward to today. As organizations have bolstered their security, hackers also evolved. Attacks today are more sophisticated and targeted than ever before. Rather than sending generic malware, hackers today carefully plot each and every attack, using unique, \u201czero-day\u201d exploits that render signature-based protections nearly useless. While a number of new security companies, like FireEye, have surfaced in recent years to try to combat this type of attack, hackers continue finding creative ways around these tools. Some hackers go so far as to buy all of the same, state-of-the-art intrusion prevention systems their targets use so they can perfectly replicate the target\u2019s exact security environment \u2014 then test their attack and virtually guarantee its success. The initial intrusion in a typical breach scenario takes minutes to a few hours \u2014 in some rare cases, days. The real damage, however, occurs  after  hackers get around the first line of defense, making new, after-the-fact breach-detection efforts so critical. Once inside a target, it\u2019s like discovering a gold mine. Hackers study their victim\u2019s internal network, carefully extend their foothold and then begin mining the valuable data they find for months, if not years, before being detected \u2014 usually by accident. Mandiant, for example, recently reported that APT1, one of China\u2019s cyber-espionage units, attacked 141 victim companies across 20 industries and stole many terabytes of compressed data in sustained attacks averaging 365 days each. The longest attack lasted more than four years. The most concerning part of all this is that very few organizations are now using new breach-detection technologies and can actually discover these ongoing breaches themselves, meaning attacks are even more destructive for their victims. Despite numerous alerts, Target, for example, didn\u2019t detect the recent breach that led to 40 million stolen credit card numbers. Rather, it was only after the U.S. Department of Justice notified the company in mid-December that Target investigators went back to figure out what happened. According to a report published by Verizon last year, this is not uncommon \u2014 only about 13 percent of security breaches are discovered internally. All these factors point to the need for robust breach detection to provide a \u201clast line of defense\u201d against these attacks, instead of just focusing on blocking the initial wave of the intrusion. While after-the-fact detection is not a new concept, the old generation of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technologies generally fall short in today\u2019s data-center environment. Why? Next-gen breach detection is solving, in essence, a classic big-data problem: To be effective, these tools need to analyze a great variety of data in high volume, and at great velocity, to determine potential breaches. Most important, the tools must be precise; too many false positives and their reports will quickly be ignored, just like the boy who cried wolf. A new crop of next-generation startups are working on this. They include Aorato, Bit9, Cybereason, Exabeam, Fortscale, LightCyber, Seculert, and Vectra Networks. Rather than relying on detecting known signatures, these companies marry big-data techniques, such as machine learning, with deep cyber security expertise to profile and understand user and machine behavior patterns, enabling them to detect this new breed of attacks. And to avoid flooding security professionals in a sea of useless alerts, these companies try to minimize the number of alerts and provide rich user interfaces that enable interactive exploration and investigation. To help illustrate how these new technologies work, think of all of the online \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d that an attacker inevitably leaves behind during each step of the attack. He generates network connections to command and control servers, for example. He moves across the organization in ways that are ever so slightly different from what\u2019s normal; he may use whatever credentials he can get his hands on to try to access sensitive resources (e.g. tries to access proprietary code on development servers using a sales executive\u2019s login). New breach-detection startups can sense all of these movements and changes. Combined with an intimate understanding of how hackers operate, they are able to finally piece together all the puzzle pieces in real-time before more significant damage has occurred. There is a lot at stake here. In the end, solutions that effectively cut through the noise and point up just a handful of highly relevant, actionable security alerts will likely become an important \u201clast line of defense\u201d and a key component of the next-gen enterprise security stack.", "tags": "[\"cyber security\", \"breach\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/shutterstock_157028330.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/paz_breach1.png?w=974&h=582 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/paz_breach2.png?w=975&h=779", "title": "Why Breach Detection Is Your New Must-Have, Cyber Security Tool"},

In addition to working at TechCrunch and being super fashionable, she reviews startups and tech products occasionally on her personal blog,  Leslie Just Joined . Walking into the  TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon  back in May,  Velina Ivanova  wasn\u2019t sure how her hack project would be perceived. It wasn\u2019t easy to coax her partners to join her in building an app which helped women (and so-inclined men) to organize their trips to the nail salon, especially when most of the other hackers were using Oculus Rift and other more popular technologies. Luckily that didn\u2019t stop Ivanova and her co-creators Hristo Hristov and Paul Llanos. Their hackathon project,  Indulge: The Nail Snob App , was  selected as the first runner-up  by the TechCrunch judges. This was not the end, but the beginning of a determination to continue building Indulge and ultimately launch it as a product in the App Store. \u201cAt the hackathon we just needed to productize, to make sure it works but then when you get out of the hackathon and have to develop a real working app, that\u2019s when the challenges came,\u201d Ivanova told me. Receiving an avalanche of positive feedback following the coverage of Indulge, Ivanova, Hristov and Llanos decided to push it from simply a hack weekend project and commit the time to developing a complete project, setting their sights on launching in the App Store. Capitalizing on the momentum from the Hackathon, the team began working on completing Indulge. Development of the app stretched into July and took about three months. Almost all of work was completed during nights and on weekends since the trio all have day-jobs. The bulk of that time was spent compiling a proprietary database of nail polishes, swatting bugs and fleshing out the product. During that time, Ivanova and the team collected feedback from their beta testers and were even approached by a nail polish brand about a potential partnership. And now? From participation in the Hackathon the coverage on TechCrunch \u201crandom people in the tech industry know our app which we couldn\u2019t have done on our own.\u201d From here they are looking to prioritize and add features, based on feedback from their strong user base. When asked if she had any suggestions for hackers about to enter the Disrupt SF Hackathon on Saturday, Ivanova said when she walked in the doors in May she was hesitant that her idea would be worth something and wondered if anyone would like it. \u201cDon\u2019t get discouraged. You never know, being different is a good thing. We were scanning nail polishes and people around us were playing with the Oculus Rift. Having a different idea might be the winning formula in the end.\u201d So who will come out of this weekend\u2019s Hackathon, and will they successfully push their projects to successful products?

Please enjoy. Seriously, though, this footage caught using the new GoPro Fetch mount for canines during a holiday weekend cottage trip was only one small part of a much longer series that kept me and my family entertained for far, far too long. I\u2019ve generally never considered myself \u2018extreme\u2019 enough to own a GoPro of my own (and I don\u2019t  have kids like Matt Burns ), but this new Fetch mount has me reconsidering a personal purchase. The dog in the video is my Quincy, a yellow lab belonging to my brother who clearly loves the water. My own pooch Chelsea basically froze when I put it on, which was hilarious but didn\u2019t produce enthralling footage. She later warmed up to it, same as most dogs would a sweater or coat, but she\u2019s not a water dog and the swimming is particularly enjoyable to watch \u2013 damn near therapeutic, in fact. A very flattering still image of me and my brother captured via the Fetch-mounted GoPro. The Fetch\u2019s adjustability means that it worked with a range of different dogs I know, from very small to very large, and the two mount locations provided an interesting shift in perspective (although the back mount in general produced much better footage). No dog managed to destroy the Fetch, though none actually tried that hard, and as you can see, it stood up well to prolonged use in the water. GoPro\u2019s growing range of mounts offers a lot of options for the action cam, which once favored the snowboarders of this world but can now entertain even the most risk averse, like myself. It\u2019s $60, and is available now from GoPro.com.", "tags": "[\"dog\", \"Video\", \"gopro\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/gopr8299.jpg?w=1024&h=768", "title": "GoPro Fetch Review: You Will Envy Your Dog\u2019s Work/Life Balance"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/apple-will-add-extra-security-measures-to-icloud-says-tim-cook/", "content": "Apple has added extra security measures to iCloud, including alerts if someone tries to change your account password, download iCloud files to a new device, or a log a new device onto an account. Users can then change their passwords immediately or notify Apple security. The alerts will start in two weeks, CEO Tim Cook  told the Wall Street Journal . In addition, Apple will also increase its use of two-factor authentication, expanding it to cover access to iCloud accounts from a mobile device when it releases its iOS update later this month. The changes come in the wake of the  recent leak of a large number of photos from celebrity accounts , allegedly from hacked iCloud accounts. Apple previously  released a statement  denying any breach within its systems, but admitting that celebrity accounts were compromised by attackers using standard phishing techniques. In his interview with the WSJ, Cook reiterated that point and said that Apple could have done more to make people aware of hackers potentially targeting their accounts or how to create more secure passwords. \u201cWhen I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece. I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That\u2019s not really an engineering thing,\u201d he said. Apple also said it will take more steps to make people aware of two-factor authentication, since most users currently don\u2019t use it.

The new Moto Hint is a single wireless earbud that comes in a variety of designs, and while it isn\u2019t quite as invisible as the headset showcased in\u00a0 Her , it is designed to give its wearer the ability to quickly and easily ask their phones questions. The Moto Hint is an accessory for the  new Moto X  specifically, and so won\u2019t bring its magic to the downmarket Moto G, but it will let you instantly query the new flagship with requests like \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather like?\u201d to instantly get a spoken forecast. You can also ask for directions, and receive turn-by-turn voice navigation, or dictate and send messages, plus of course make and receive calls. Finishes include fabric, leather and wood to match your Moto X, along with both black and white body accents and silver or black metallic finishes. Does having just a single earbud make you look more or less crazy when you\u2019re talking to yourself? It\u2019s a question we\u2019ll have to wait a while to find out, as this ships in the U.S. later this fall.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/moto-360-smartwatch/", "content": "The Moto 360 has been unveiled previously, and is arguably the most anticipated  Android Wear  smartwatch, owing partly to its attractive round face. The wearable is finally landing, complete with heart rate monitor, in both black and gray metal finishes, with retail availability kicking off today at noon EST from Motorola.com, Best Buy and Google Play for $249.99. Two new metal band options will be available beginning \u201clater this fall,\u201d with the price rising to $299.99, and aftermarket metal band options will be on sale for $79.99 when that launches. At the same time, leather bands will also go on sale as official Motorola accessories for $29.99 apiece. We already knew a lot about the Moto 360, besides firm pricing and availability, but to recap the Android Wear watch has an edge-to-edge round display (with an occlusion at the bottom for radios and sensors) and is made from stainless steel. It includes a pedometer, and weighs 1.72 ounces, which is less than either the LG G Watch or the Samsung Gear Live. It also boasts wireless charging, another unique function (although we hear the  iWatch is getting that, too ). The premium materials and wireless charging, in addition to the design, are what Motorola is hoping will prompt buyers to spend an extra $20 \u2013 $50 above what the competition is charging. Like all Android Wear devices, it offers wake-on-wrist-flick, automatic voice response via the \u201cOk Google\u201d trigger, and activity tracking. It\u2019s compatible with any Android phone or tablet running Android 4.3 or higher, and it has IP67 dust and water resistance for splash and rain protection, and submersion of up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. It has a Gorilla Glass screen case, and Horween is producing the leather straps. Motorola is offering Motorola Connect to personalize the experience and differentiate its device software-wise form the rest of the Android Wear crop. This companion app for your smartphone lets you specify height, weight and age for more accurate activity tracking, allows for watch face customization (change colors and font choices), as well as provides limited location tracking for lost devices (it\u2019ll show you your smartwatch\u2019s last recorded location, rather than live updates, as it doesn\u2019t have its own internal GPS). Tech specs for the Moto 360 include a 1.56-inch 320\u00d7290 display, good for 205ppi, and it has a 46mm diameter watchface. The 320mAh battery will get you about a day of mixed usage, and the TI OMAP 3 processor should give you all the oomph you need. 4GB of internal storage and 512MB of RAM is pretty standard, as is the vibration motor included for notifications. Personally, I\u2019ve found that Android Wear doesn\u2019t yet have what I need to make it a daily necessity, but perhaps Motorola\u2019s careful attention to design will convince this traditional watch fan.", "tags": "[\"Motorola\", \"smartwatch\", \"Android Wear\", \"Moto 360\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/moto-360.png?w=738 http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/moto-360-charging.png?w=906&h=593 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/moto-360-gray.png?w=964&h=661", "title": "The Moto 360 Smartwatch Is Finally Here, Available Today For $249.99"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/moto-x-2014/", "content": "Motorola is updating its flagship Moto X, and it\u2019s an improvement that makes one of the best deals in mobile even better, even if it doesn\u2019t completely revolutionize what came before. The original Moto X was one of the best phones last year, and despite a change in the company\u2019s ownership from Google to Lenovo, this new Moto X looks to be a worthy successor. Google\u2019s new Moto X has a metal frame, a 5.2-inch display with full HD resolution and 423 ppi pixel density, Android 4.4.4 KitKat, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 2.5GHz processor and an Adreno GPU. The camera on the rear is a 13 megapixel affair, which can capture 4K video and has 4x zoom, plus a ring flash surrounding the lens for neat effects and even lighting. It has four mics vs. three on the original Moto X for better sound capture and background noise isolation, and it has a 2300 mAh battery with a new turbo charging feature that delivers 8 hours of use in just 15 minutes of charging. Back options include the original wood backs from the Moto X customizer options, and now a new leather choice for more premium fun, from U.S.-based luxury leather provider Horween (which you may recognize from watch bands, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing). Moto\u2019s new X offers a \u201cpure Android\u201d experience, cleaning up bloatware even further and letting Motorola deliver updates within days of their release on Google Nexus devices, according to the company. It promises some additional features, however, including some introduced in the previous generation like Touchless Control and Active Display. You can now do more with voice commands via Moto Voice, including operating apps like Facebook and YouTube, as well as setting a custom phrase to trigger voice operation, including whatever colloquial you may choose. Might we suggest \u201cYo, Moto X\u201d? Moto Assist can read text messages out loud or turn off notifications during a meeting or at night, and intelligently reactivate them when you need to. Moto Display will put up to three recent notifications on the screen even when it\u2019s mostly asleep, with the company\u2019s trademark \u201cslide to preview\u201d action. This is one of the Moto\u2019s best Android innovations, in my opinion, so it\u2019s great to see it reappear here. With Moto Actions, the phone knows your hand is coming close and will display those notices, plus you can wave in the air above the device to silence your ringer or prolong your sleep by delaying your alarm. Moto Maker is back with Horween leather options, as mentioned, and there\u2019s even a carrier free version that offers speedier updates and no contracts to deal with. The new 13 megapixel camera is tied to a gesture activation that lets you pick up the phone and twist your wrist twice to jump right to the capture app, and a motion detection engine will suggest trying a new frame if it perceives you moving around too much when you snap your original. Tech tricks on the phone include three IR emitters and one receiver that work together for improved gesture recognition, from either above or below the phone, and at a greater distance than most. A nano coating will offer some degree of water resistance, both outside and in, and without requiring any flaps or covers for outlets. The screen uses the industry standard Gorilla Glass to protect against bumps and scratches. 16GB and 32GB versions will be available, and the front camera captures images at 2MP, while recording video at 1080p. It ships beginning later this month in the U.S., and will retail for $99.99 on a two-year agreement at most carriers, while an unlocked version will be available carrier-free for $499.99 at Motorola.com.", "tags": "[\"Android\", \"moto\", \"Motorola\", \"moto x\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-04-at-6-08-05-pm.png?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/moto-x-variety.png?w=976&h=672 http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/moto-x-hand.png?w=1024&h=745", "title": "The All New Moto X Arrives Later This Month For $499.99 Unlocked"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/you-can-stand-under-my-umbrella-here/", "content": "As a staunch introvert who prefers wide swaths of personal space, I find the idea behind  Umbrella Here  frightening, yet strangely compelling. The creators of the project, which is  currently raising funds on Kickstarter , want to \u201cbring strangers together on rainy days\u201d with a Bluetooth light that attaches to the top of your umbrella and an app alerting people that you are willing to share it. You can change the color of the light to reflect your mood: green if you are wiling to share it, for example, or red if you aren\u2019t. Patience Lee, Umbrella Here\u2019s user interface designer, tells TechCrunch that the project originally started for a competition called the  Interaction Award , a design competition that seeks to \u201cfacilitate communication between people and communities.\u201d All four members of Umbrella Here\u2019s Hong Kong-based team are recent graduates from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where they majored in interaction design. \u201cWe remembered that during rainy days, people without umbrellas would just stand outside the Hong Kong subway station waiting for the rain to stop. The four of us have experienced times when we had an umbrella with us and felt very embarrassed to ask the person next to us to share our umbrella,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThis is the reason why we came up with Umbrella Here. A signal that helps you tell people that you are willing to share your umbrella, instead of needing to ask a stranger directly.\u201d Of course, Umbrella Here\u2019s concept will only come to fruition if there are enough people using the light and app to create a network. In order to get more users, Lee says that Umbrella Here is currently in discussions with a large corporation to buy the light as a gift for clients, as well as several social networks to integrate Umbrella Here with their platforms. Even if you aren\u2019t keen on the idea of sharing your umbrella with a stranger, Umbrella Here still has several functions that might be helpful. The app, which lets you keep a record of the people you have connected with through Umbrella Here and add them as friends through different social networks, also tracks weather reports and will send you an alert reminding you to take your umbrella along with you if it looks like it\u2019s going to rain. The Umbrella Here light will also turn different colors depending on the temperature and blink when it is about to rain. To be sure, you can also depend on weather forecasts and looking out the window to remember if you need to bring your umbrella, but then you won\u2019t be part of Umbrella Here\u2019s network. The project ends on September 17 and has already raised more than two-thirds of its $15,000 goal, so there are clearly plenty of backers who are intrigued by the idea (and even willing to put it into practice). If Umbrella Here catches your fancy and you order one, the team promises that you will receive it by January 2015. Umbrella Here already has a manufacturing-ready prototype and is ready for production if its  Kickstarter campaign  succeeds.", "tags": "[\"weather\", \"Asia\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/umbrellahere2.png?w=700 https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/umbrellahere1.png?w=680&h=381", "title": "You Can Stand Under My Umbrella Here"},

Motorola\u2019s new mid-range phone offers a larger 5-inch display with 1280\u00d7720 resolution for 294 ppi pixel density, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor clocked at 1.2GHz, Corning Gorilla Glass, with Android 4.4 and a guaranteed update to Android L when that becomes available. It has both single SIM and dual SIM variants, with 8GB and 16GB storage options, and a brand new removable microSD slot which supports cards of up to 32GB. A new 8 megapixel camera also boasts a faster f2.0 aperture, and the front camera is improved to 2 megapixels from one on the original Moto G. The volume button can now trip the camera\u2019s shutter when the app\u2019s open, another new trick, and it has a double stereo speaker, vs. the single mono version on the first-generation device. 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE, 720HD video capture and special digital TV tuners for Brazil only round out the hardware package. Motorola achieved something truly impressive with the hardware package it put together for the original Moto G, and this one still boasts long-lasting battery life\u00a0to its 2070mAh powerhouse (good for up to 24 hours of continuous mixed usage, per Motorola), plus a pared down version of Android that closely mimics stock Android for easier updates. The interchangeable Moto G Shells are back again, letting users swap out plastic rear cases depending on their preferences. Software features include the best from the previous model, like the Motorola\u2019s Voice Actions, and Motorola Alert, which lets you share locations with specific contacts so they can make sure you\u2019re safe. Motorola Assist is also present here, with quiet hours for when you sleep, auto meeting detection based on your calendar, automatic replies via text to missed calls from your favorite contacts and more. Motorola isn\u2019t wasting any time bringing its new model to market, either \u2013 the new Moto G is available immediately from Motorola.com for $179.99, unlocked and off contract. It\u2019s also on sale\u00a0as of today\u00a0in India, France, the UK, Brazil, Spain and Germany.

Existing investors True Ventures and Passion Capital also participated\u00a0in the round.\u00a0It\u2019s the first outside investment for\u00a0the 2012-founded Swedish startup\u00a0since last October, and brings\u00a0its total funding to-date to $12.2 million. The lightweight 5 megapixel Narrative Clip camera is designed to be worn\u00a0on the person \u2014 for instance clipped to a lapel or the neck of a T-Shirt \u2014 and once set going it takes a photo at set intervals, such as 30 seconds or two minutes. Users can also double tap on the device to capture a shot on demand.\u00a0The camera hardware has companion Android and iOS apps that let users view and organize their snaps \u2014 with the software automatically organizing shots into discrete sequences that can be searched and\u00a0shared. The small size and minimalist looks of the camera hardware\u00a0helps avoid it looking too intrusive. Sure you\u2019ll soon spot when someone is wearing it, but unlike a geektastic face-wearable like Google Glass, it\u2019s easy to quickly forget the Narrative is watching \u2014 leading to more candid shots. Narrative supplemented\u00a0its original seed funding with a successful 2012\u00a0 Kickstarter\u00a0crowdfunding\u00a0campaign , which\u00a0raised more than $550,000, before attracting  $3 million in VC funding \u00a0last year with a plan to ramp up\u00a0globally. The startup was formerly known as Memento but\u00a0rebranded to Narrative at that time, as part of global marketing\u00a0plans. The\u00a0latest funding for the startup will\u00a0specifically be targeted at\u00a0growing\u00a0in the US market, with expansion of\u00a0its\u00a0local sales and retail efforts on the cards \u2014 including opening an office in San Francisco to act as its US base. It will also use the funding to expand its team, and is  currently hiring  for several positions\u00a0\u2014 including developer, sales, logistics, designer and ecommerce roles. Commenting on the funding in a statement, Om Malik, partner at True Ventures and a\u00a0Narrative board member said: \u201cWe are only just touching the surface of the creative uses for the Narrative Clip.\u00a0We are thrilled to continue our support of this innovative company and its wonderful founding team.\u201d", "tags": "[\"Khosla Ventures\", \"lifelogging\", \"Narrative\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-05-at-9-42-32-am.png?w=738", "title": "Lifelogging Wearable Camera Startup, Narrative, Gets $8M For U.S. Push"},

The website depicts high-quality renders of a new iPhone model as viewed from the side. The images are in line with what we\u2019ve seen before, showing an iPhone with contours that resemble the iPad mini and iPad Air, but don\u2019t go believing them to be the honest, authoritative last word. The website also supposedly reveals some of the specs of the\u00a0upcoming device, offering a reservation choice between 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, as well as touting a 3-megapixel front camera, improved Touch ID fingerprint reader, and a new quad-core A8 processor. The battery also gets a bump up to 2,100 mAh, a big bump from the roughly 1,560 mAh one in the current iPhone 5s. Originally, the site contained the word \u201ciPhone\u201d in plain sight, but China Telecom appears to have altered the graphic since this was first spotted by  ZDNet  earlier this morning to feature a pixelated (but still obvious) version of the word. It\u2019s very possible this is some kind of \u201cwishful thinking\u201d ad campaign undertaken by China Telecom. The company  hyped pre-orders of the new iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c last year with images  shared on social media, but the ones of the iPhone 5c turned out to be false, and while the one of the 5s looked accurate, that might have been no more than a lucky guess as opposed\u00a0to special inside information. China Telecom fuelling a hype cycle is in its interest, and the fact is that whatever Apple announces, those who sign up for its pre-order interest won\u2019t be disappointed, so it\u2019s free to make claims and educated guesses to add a little flash to what would otherwise be a \u201cSign up to find out more about Apple\u2019s new stuff\u2026 whatever that is!\u201d page with a single field and submit button.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/05/beepi-prime/", "content": "About six months ago, a new startup called  Beepi  launched to become the  easiest way for users to buy and sell cars online , building a marketplace that guarantees the quality of vehicles while also ensuring sellers get a fair price. Now the company is opening up its marketplace to a wider area of buyers, introducing a  \u201cPrime\u201d option  in states neighboring California to have cars shipped to them for $999. Beepi simplifies the process of selling a car by sending an inspector to verify the quality of the vehicle being listed and to set a guaranteed selling price. That price will be more than what sellers will get from taking a car to a dealership, and if the car doesn\u2019t sell to one of Beepi\u2019s customers within 30 days, the company will buy it for the listed price and sell the car itself. For buyers, Beepi provides a fair price but also the peace of mind that comes from its inspection process and money-back guarantee. Its technicians do an intensive 185-point inspection and if a car doesn\u2019t pass, it doesn\u2019t get listed. The marketplace also offers a 10-day, no-questions-asked return policy and a three-month, 3,000-mile warranty on all parts and service. Buyers can apply to finance a vehicle through a financial firm that Beepi has partnered with, or they can pay for a used vehicle with up to five credit cards together. (It also accepts Bitcoin, and has seen a few cars purchased with the cryptocurrency.) The company takes a 9 percent share of all sales that happen on its platform, and since it takes out the middleman, it can offer better prices without a dramatic markup that buyers see at dealership. Beepi launched in the San Francisco Bay Area, and saw a fair amount of success there. But it recently expanded to Los Angeles, which is the largest car market in the U.S. Those two cities by themselves offer a fairly liquid supply of cars, but Beepi wanted to expand its potential market of buyers. As a result, it\u2019s now launching a service called Beepi Prime that will enable buyers from outside those markets to purchase cars and have them delivered. Beepi Prime offers delivery to 140 cities in Arizona, Nevada and Oregon, opening up the company\u2019s marketplace to states neighboring California. For $999, buyers in those states can have a vehicle delivered within five days and receive the same service as the company\u2019s local customers. (Buyers in California still receive free shipping anywhere in the state.) Buyers outside of California will also receive the car fully detailed and receiving a personal car tour form one of Beepi\u2019s inspectors upon arrival. In other words, the company isn\u2019t shipping these vehicles through some wholesale third-party shipping option, but actually transporting them on its own delivery trucks driven by its own employees. At $999, shipping is less than one would usually pay for one of those services, anyway. For Beepi Prime customers the same money-back guarantee still applies, and it also extends to the $999 shipping fee. That is, if a customer decides they don\u2019t want to keep a car within 10 days, Beepi will fully refund the purchase, shipping fee and all. Beepi Prime dramatically opens up the marketplace\u2019s potential customer base, and that\u2019s big news for a company that is already currently on a $10 million revenue run rate. Beepi has raised about $6 million in funding, with investors that include Redpoint Ventures, OLX founder Fabrice Grinda, iVillage co-founder Tina Sharkey, Homeaway co-founder Brian Sharples, former Loopnet CEO Rich Boyle, and Silicon Valley Bank.", "tags": "[\"Beepi\", \"Startups\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/beepi-delivery.jpg?w=738", "title": "Peer-To-Peer Auto Marketplace Beepi Adds A \u2018Prime\u2019 Option, Now Shipping To 140 Cities"},

The company\u2019s ambition goes far beyond hosting your WordPress blog or test server on a $5/month machine however and today it is taking a next step in this direction by announcing its support for  CoreOS , the highly popular container-centric Linux distribution for massive-scale deployments. \u201cThere is a lot of community excitement for CoreOS,\u201d said Mitch Wainer, co-founder and CMO at DigitalOcean in a statement today. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to announce that developers can begin using CoreOS immediately, ensuring the resiliency of their architecture, as their ability to scale at massive levels increases.\u201d DigitalOcean tells me that it believes its platform is now the \u201ceasiest and least expensive way to try out CoreOS and get started using containers on any cloud service\u201d Given that running a CoreOS cluster is a bit more intricate than just firing up the latest version of Ubuntu on a single server, DigitalOcean users need to take a few extra steps, too. They need to supply a  configuration file  when they create a new service (or \u201cdroplet\u201d in DigitalOcean\u2019s parlance). CoreOS, after all, needs to know what other servers it can talk to. It\u2019s not all that complex to set up these configuration files, but it\u2019s also not trivial by any means. With the addition of CoreOS support, DigitalOcean is clearly trying to expand its reach beyond the basic virtual server market. And if it wants to be taken seriously in the competition with AWS and Google Cloud Platform, it does need to offer exactly these kind of services. As the company\u2019s co-founder Ben Uretsky has  often told me , the company was so busy just scaling up to meet demand over the last few years that basic product development like adding more distributions often fell by the wayside. Now that DigitalOcean has  plenty  of funding and a larger staff, it\u2019s able to focus more on adding new features like today\u2019s CoreOS launch.", "tags": "[\"cloud\", \"hosting\", \"coreos\", \"digitalocean\", \"Developer\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/coreos-blogc2adimage.png?w=738", "title": "DigitalOcean Partners With CoreOS To Bring Large-Scale Cluster Deployments To Its Platform"},

As the company  announced today , a first update will bring offline music playback and GPS support to Android Wear. A second update later in the year will also enable downloadable watch faces. With offline music playback, users will be able to listen to music that is stored directly on the watch with the help of Bluetooth headphones. How exactly you will get your music onto the watch (and whether\u00a0apps like Spotify will be able to support this feature) remains to be seen. Once Android Wear supports built-in GPS sensors, the watch will be able to track your location without the help of your smartphone.

Flywheel tells me it plans to use this new funding to focus on product development. \u201cIn the immediate future we have staging sites and an affiliate/referral program launching,\u201d Flywheel CEO and co-founder Dusty Davidson told me earlier this week. \u201cBeyond that it\u2019s things like an API and 3rd party integrations, and other features to improve the workflow of designers and agencies building sites on WordPress.\u201d The service already focuses on ensuring that its workflow is as  straightforward as possible  for its users. Creating a new site already just takes a few seconds and once it\u2019s up and running, the service makes it easy to add collaborators, bill clients and do most of the other things that designers and freelancers need to handle when they work on a WordPress project. One nice feature of Flywheel is that users only pay for a site once it goes live \u2014 and at that point, it\u2019s likely the client who will pay the hosting bill anyway. Flywheel\u2019s  pricing  is mostly based on how many visits a site gets per month and starts at $15/month for up to 5,000 visits. Starting today, the service also offers its users bulk pricing. For $100 a month, they can run up to 10 sites with an aggregate total of 150,000 visits on the service or 25 sites with 500,000 visits for $250 a month.", "tags": "[\"flywheel\", \"hosting\", \"Wordpress\", \"Fundings & Exits\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/flywheel.jpg?w=738", "title": "Flywheel Raises $1.2M For Its Designer-Centric WordPress Hosting Platform"},

In just two years since its founding, the company has seen incredible growth and now counts customers in all 50 states and over $11 billion worth of crops under its management, a number that has tripled in the last six months. FarmLogs estimates 15% of the farms within the United States are using its services. The company was in Silicon Valley and later moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan. Earlier this year, Jesse Vollmar, CEO and co-founder explained the company\u2019s focus is building out its product to intelligently predict and optimize crop rotations as well as automate activity data collection. \u201cWe are excited to have earned the trust of farmers around the country,\u201d said Vollmar in a statement. \u201cReaching this major growth milestone means our product is now able to make a substantial positive impact on US agriculture. The pace at which we are growing is a testament to the tremendous quality of people working at FarmLogs and our ability to build a valuable product that puts the farmer first.\u201d FarmLogs\u2019 data-driven approach to farming leans on the mobile web to help crop farmers quickly and efficiently forecast profits, track expenses and more efficiently schedule operations. Best yet, the software utilizes GPS for additional data about any given location\u2019s historical weather data. Farms can quickly jot down notes and input data using the software\u2019s mobile app. It\u2019s a radical revolution for the age-old industry. \u201cFarmLogs makes it incredibly easy for farmers to know what is happening in their fields. Rain, nutrients, crop health, soil conditions, and machine data all analyzed and delivered through intuitive web/mobile UI,\u201d Vollmar said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the most advanced precision ag research from the academic world and bringing it to every farm in the US.\u201d FarmLogs graduated from Y Combinator\u2019s Winter 2012 class and went on to raise a $4 million Series A round in early 2014. The cash influx lead to the growth by allowing the company to increase its headcount from 8 to 18 full-time employees.", "tags": "[\"Startups\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/3c32d15.png?w=646", "title": "Farming Startup FarmLogs Triples Market Share In Last Six Months"},

What\u2019s that?\u201d Well I\u2019m here to tell you:  ZIRX  is an on-demand valet startup that charges $15 a day to park your car (and bring it back to you)\u2026 And it just raised $6.4 million from Norwest Venture Partners and Trinity Ventures to make parking in San Francisco a whole lot easier. ZIRX allows users to have their cars valeted from locations in San Francisco by designating where they are (or will be soon) via a mobile app. The company then dispatches a valet to come retrieve the vehicle and park it in a secured garage nearby that ZIRX has partnered with. When it comes time to leave, users simply request their to be brought wherever they are and another valet drives the vehicle back. With both interactions, the user is required to validate that they are the car owner with a four-digit code, to ensure hand-off to the right person. Pickup and drop-off take about 5-7 minutes, according to founder Sean Behr. The company seeks to eliminate the issues and high cost associated with finding parking in the city, by having valets meet drivers \u2014 rather than the other way around \u2014 and by charging a $15 per-use fee for parking. That\u2019s in-line or even cheaper than the cost of many garages around the city during regular hours, and it\u2019s much cheaper than the cost of parking during special events like concerts or ball games. The service also has a side benefit where users can use a \u201csecret menu\u201d to have their cars washed or gas topped off while they are busy. To enable the service, ZIRX partners with garages in different parts of the city, and has built a logistics layer to route its valets around to pick up different cars and drop them off at the nearest garage. ZIRX is now available in select parts of San Francisco, and expanding to new areas over time as it secures partnerships with garages in different neighborhoods and tests demand. It raised its funding to help drive that expansion in San Francisco and other markets, and has also added a couple of board members. Along with the raise, Norwest partner Sergio Monsalve and Trinity general partner Ajay Chopra have both joined the company\u2019s board.", "tags": "[\"Trinity Ventures\", \"norwest venture partners\", \"Collaborative Consumption\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/zirx-agent-customer.png?w=738", "title": "On-Demand Valet Startup ZIRX Raises $6.4 Million From Norwest And Trinity"},

By making it easier to find and acquire, Google is slowly broadening its potential user base for the devices, even if it isn\u2019t making any claims about a consumer launch or taking the hardware out of beta. I remain skeptical about the future of Glass, and whether we\u2019ll see it evolve into something beyond the marginal curiosity it is today, but Google putting it up on its main devices store should at least remind people that it\u2019s still around, and that developers are still building software for the face-based computer.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/05/millennials-are-the-largest-group-of-smartphone-owners-and-adoption-is-still-growing/", "content": "Millennials, one of the largest generational groups in the U.S., on par with the Baby Boomers, are also the largest group of smartphone owners, says Nielsen in  a report  out today. And their adoption of the devices is still growing: by the second quarter of this year, 85% of those aged 18 to 24 owned a smartphone, and 86% of those aged 25 to 34 did. That\u2019s up from 77% and 80%, respectively, over the same time last year. It\u2019s worth also pointing out, on the eve of Apple\u2019s big iPhone 6 reveal next week, that the smartphone in question is more likely to be an Android phone. Nielsen notes that over half (52%) of U.S. smartphones run Android, with Apple iOS accounting for a 42.7% share, and \u201cother\u201d OS\u2019s (Windows Phone, Blackberry, etc.) making up the rest. But while it didn\u2019t break out the number of Millennials specifically who chose Android over iPhone,  earlier research  from comScore this year did. And it, too,\u00a0 found  that Android dominated, with half of Millennials using Android, and 44% on the iPhone. Though neither report speculated as to why that\u2019s the case, the choice to use Android is often more about the cost of the phone itself versus a decision to align oneself with a particular hardware manufacturer or software system. Android phones extend further down into the low-end of the market in terms of price, and that makes them more broadly adopted \u2013 not just in the U.S., but  worldwide . But whether Millennials are choosing one mobile platform or the other, we\u2019ve long heard reports of how addicted they are to their devices. Remember the\u00a0stories\u00a0from earlier this year that\u00a0said Millennials believed  their smartphones were more important to them than deodorant ?  Or even their cars ? The millennials are very heavy mobile users, spending 14.5 hours per week on their phones, talking, texting or using social media,  it\u2019s also been said . For those designing the next mobile generation of mobile apps, or even just trying to adapt their current online offering to this mobile-first crowd, these metrics matter. In fact, in Nielsen\u2019s smartphone app  report  from this July, the firm found that those aged 25 to 44 (a group which includes Millennials up to Gen X\u2019ers) use the most apps per month, at 29 on average. But it was those in the 18 to 24 bracket which spent the most  time  on their phones. This group was on their phone for 37 hours, 6 minutes, on average, per month \u2013 again, largely engaged with social networking apps, entertainment, and communication utilities. It\u2019s no wonder then, that I have an iPhone folder of messaging apps that\u2019s now 10 pages deep on my phone. (It\u2019s for research!) But now the question is whether or not the mobile platform itself will ever be able to grow a service as large as what incumbent Facebook was able to do on the web, before it successfully made\u00a0the mobile leap. After all, those that do manage to establish a solid mobile\u00a0footprint are often snapped up by Facebook anyway (e.g. Instagram, Whatsapp), it seems. Snapchat (which is probably delighted by this whole iCloud hack thing \u2013 shoulda used Snapchat!), is one notable exception.", "tags": "[\"Mobile\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/twotap-iphone.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/smartphone-wirepost-chart-1.jpg?w=636&h=595", "title": "Millennials Are The Largest Group Of Smartphone Owners, And Adoption Is Still Growing "},

Like its web-based counterpart, the app allows customers to create and customize stationary, cards and other gifts via a variety of personalization options, including by occasion, paper type, trim, envelope color, and more. The app also allows you to build your products using photos from your iPad\u2019s gallery or Photo Stream, Facebook, Instagram, and, of course ,Shutterfly, as well as apply photo filters. Though the name \u201cprints\u201d brings to mind photo printouts or other paper products, Tiny Prints actually includes more categories beyond stationary or cards, like its competitors Sincerely or Red Stamp currently offer. \u00a0 It also lets you use your photos to decorate other gifts, like coffee mugs, iPhone, iPad and Samsung cases, notebooks, photo frames, ornaments, photo blocks, glass prints, and more. You can even buy photo-printed pillows, if you\u2019d like, as well as those that are patterned and have\u00a0a monogram initial, or other text. These are not cheap, however \u2013 the pillows are around $45-50 each. Other products range from just under $20 to the $40\u2019s as well, from a quick glance around, which makes it competitive with, or pricier than, some of the other options out there for photo gifts, like apps HelloPics, CafePress\u2019s MagicMoments, Print Studio, Madesquare and others. But Tiny Prints prides itself on  things like paper quality , which is why it may charge more. Plus, Shutterfly is one of the top photo print destinations today, so it can help drive its current customers to this\u00a0newest app thanks to its trusted name (and its sizable marketing budget). You can use the new Tiny Prints app to get started with your project, then pick up where you left off via the Tiny Prints website, which is another differentiator between this and its mobile-only competition. There are some other nice touches as well, such as the ability to \u201cpreview\u201d the project before buying via mock-ups that show the product from different angles.

The two of us were able to catch up this week and  decompress \u00a0\u00a0\u2013 a word burners use to describe how they adjust back into life after experiencing Black Rock City. This was both our first time at Burning Man. This is our decompression conversation: Me: Hi Grover, may I call you Grover or would you prefer your playa name? Grover: I did not have a playa name but I\u2019ve never had a nickname. Nobody\u2019s ever given me a nickname. Grover is unique enough. Me: Grover it is. So what\u2019s different now, after you\u2019ve been to Burning Man? GN: I\u2019d been talking for several years with  Larry Harvey  before I went. I had kind of an intellectual understanding of what it was. I read up and watched videos. But there were two things I got wrong \u2013 I went and saw something that was more impressive than what I had ever imagined. I intellectually knew, but the amount of work and the art and the amount of stuff was bigger and more impressive than I realized. I have been to the Louvre. This was more impressive. Not that the Louvre or those places aren\u2019t impressive, but I didn\u2019t expect it. Me: How did you feel leaving Burning Man, leaving the place? Was it hard to do? GN: Well I hitched a ride with a guy with an RV and the battery died on our car. I was going to shave and shower but there\u2019\u00a0were\u00a0no hotels anywhere. So it\u2019s 5 am and we get dropped off at one of the casinos in Reno but there was no room. So we\u2019re in the Starbucks, my wife and I, and we get a shuttle ride to the airport and we see a guy covered in dust, no shoes. And we\u2019re covered in dust, too. All of us burners. This other guy comes over to the guy with no shoes and gives him his other shoes. Then they parted ways. They didn\u2019t know each other. I\u2019m thinking both of those guys and me are for decades going to remember this moment. Me:\u00a0Did you feel like you\u2019d left home? GN: Oh, I don\u2019t know I could call it that\u2026I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d gone somewhere and come back. I didn\u2019t know what to call it. It\u2019s not quite that you are back to reality. It was a more confusing homecoming because I\u2019m already thinking about next time. That\u2019s different. I started noticing when I went back to shaking hands instead of hugging them. I\u2019m not really a hugger. I don\u2019t approve of promiscuous hugging. I shake hands with my dad, even. I got so used to hugging that shaking hands felt odd for a bit after. Me: And now? GN: I\u2019m back to shaking hands now. Me: How did you decompress or come down from the whole experience? GN: I wrote three articles about it. Me: I read the one you wrote for  the Guardian . In it you said: Some self-professed \u201cprogressives\u201d whined at the thought of my attending what they believed was a ghetto for liberal hippies. Yes, there was a gentleman who skateboarded without elbow or kneepads \u2013 or any knickers whatsover. Yes, I rode in cars dressed-up as cats, bees and spiders; I watched trucks carrying pirate ships and 30 dancers. I drank absinthe. But anyone complaining about a Washington wonk like me at Burning Man is not a Burner himself: The first principle of Burning Man is \u201cradical inclusiveness\u201d, which pretty much rules out the nobody-here-but-us liberals \u201cgated community\u201d nonsense. GN: Ya, I\u2019d wanted to go for awhile, though  (Grover had wanted to go in 2012 but  there was a scheduling conflict  between Burning Man and the Republican National Convention in Tampa) . Me: Did you have any revelations while you were there? GN: How few rules it took. By having a sketched out city, if you live on this grid, everyone can find you. The number of rules are almost all state laws. The rules were way down. There are 4000 federal laws. They put together a city of strangers. They found fewer rules works, not more rules and even the rules they have come with a reason. Even the power of social sanctions\u2026you have social shaming for throwing wrappers on the ground. If you are walking a mile down the road and you throw a wrapper on the ground there\u2019s nobody there but you don\u2019t do it because that is what everyone does. Also, wear lighting at night. People do it because\u00a0they\u2019ve been told to and so you don\u2019t get run over. It makes sense. People lived with the loud music. Nobody said I\u2019m calling the cops. There were camps on the edge and people who liked the loud music and wanted that could just go there. Me: So now that you are back and in the \u201creal\u201d world, will you go to a decompression party? GN: Oh ya, I\u2019ve been invited to one in Anacostia. This guy invited me. It\u2019s a community. I talked to my wife and I think we\u2019ll bring the kids to that one. They say it\u2019s kid friendly.", "tags": "[]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/8565451957_dbb1736785_z.jpg?w=640", "title": "The One Where Grover Norquist And I Decompress From Burning Man"},

The new M chips allow users to build much thinner designs, since they\u2019re incredibly energy-efficient and can run cool enough that they don\u2019t require a heat-fighting fan in the chassis. Typically, even in devices designed to be super thin and portable like the Intel Core-powered Surface Pro 3, there\u2019s a fan (no matter how well-engineered, quiet and efficient) that still takes up plenty of room and makes some noise. Acer\u2019s new Chromebook 13 offers a fanless design, but it also runs on an Nvidia Tegra K1 processor that was originally designed for mobile, and it runs Chrome OS, not full-fledged Windows. New 2-in-1 devices from OEMs including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba are hitting store shelves beginning this holiday season that offer both full Windows, with performance that, while it isn\u2019t what you\u2019d get out of Intel\u2019s top-of-the-line current generation Core processors, still beats the heck out of the performance on top-level models from just a few years ago. It also offers a huge advantage in terms of battery draw, delivering up to eight hours of continues video play. Plus, as mentioned, the absence of a need for a fan means that OEMs can build much thinner cases for their devices \u2013 some are even thinner than 9mm, which is slimmer than a AAA battery, Intel notes, and small compared to even today\u2019s slimmest laptops, and the MacBook Air at its meatier end. Slender devices might make it easier for Microsoft to embrace the touch-friendly part of Windows 8, but it also looks to be de-emphasizing that part of the OS with Windows 9, so we\u2019ll see if that affects the design direction of OEM hardware.", "tags": "[\"thin\", \"notebooks\", \"Intel\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-31-at-2-12-30-pm.png?w=738", "title": "Intel\u2019s New Core M Processors Will Bring Thin, Fanless Convertible Notebooks This Holiday"},

If you are a Luminate publisher \u2014 there are 10,000 of them, he notes \u2014 the JavaScript snippet will no longer run anything on your site. \u201cIf your site(s) have individually earned over $10, you will be receiving a final payment for each site by September 30, 2014. If you are a Luminate Direct advertiser, you will be refunded the remainder of your balance by September 30, 2014.\u201d All Luminate publishers, advertisers and experts will be able to login and access account information until October 1, 2014. This is Yahoo\u2019s 33rd acquisition, and one in a string focused on building out its media business. Other recent purchases in the same vein have included  Flurry \u00a0and\u00a0 RayV .", "tags": "[\"luminate\", \"Yahoo\", \"Fundings & Exits\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/640_yahoo.jpg?w=640", "title": "Yahoo Acquires, Shuts Down Luminate, An Interactive Image Platform"},

While services like  Getty  are available, I\u2019ve personally never spent a dime for an image in an article I\u2019ve written \u2014 it\u2019s always been easier to do a quick search on Flickr or to shoot my own photos. Photo-sharing service  EyeEm  wants to offer publishers an option somewhere in between Flickr and paid photo services, and it\u2019s  partnering with the Huffington Post\u00a0to roll it out. This week, EyeEm\u00a0expanded its partnership with HuffPo, which  previously consisted of the service\u2019s competitive \u201cMissions.\u201d \u00a0In addition to those time-based challenges, EyeEm users  can now see what kind of content HuffPo reporters are interested in  and submit their work if they think it fits the bill. For those who think their own stories might interesting to the site, EyeEm has launched a  \u201cHuffington Post Stories\u201d album \u00a0that anyone can submit photos to with descriptions of the broader story they\u2019d like to tell. The startup says it\u2019ll monitor that album for cool tidbits and connect photographers with the publication when it finds something worth expanding into a longer blog post. While EyeEm\u2019s partnership with the Huffington Post is a great opportunity for the photographers who do end up getting their photos credited on the site, I think it\u2019s more interesting as an indicator for the direction the startup would like to go over the coming months. All signs seem to indicate that EyeEm\u00a0 wants  to be the next generation of stock photography. Since March of this year, the company has offered a collection of images shared on the service  as a collection on Getty Images. \u00a0That always felt like an in-between step, a way for the service to provide the top-notch photographers in its community a wider reach as it builds out the  EyeEm Market . The current method of rounding up content for the Huffington Post\u00a0also gives off that awkward vibe of being a solution bridging what its users are comfortable with and that end goal. I could very well be wrong on this, but it seems to me that the ideal solution for EyeEm is to have even closer integration with its media partners \u2014 instead of putting up a blog post or a new challenge every few weeks, HuffPo reporters and editors could somehow generate their own challenges (or even send notifications to EyeEm power users) asking for the kind of photographs they\u2019re looking for and immediately sift through photos on the service. EyeEm could further differentiate such a service by making the process of choosing the right picture simpler for journalists. I\u2019ve chatted with several of my colleagues about this topic, and anecdotally, most agree that the tagging and search functions in content management systems and stock photo services are generally horrendous. Even on Flickr, where millions of photos are available for free, you basically have to offer the search gods a sacrificial lamb if you want to get anything decent in a few minutes of browsing. Just last month,  EyeEm announced that it acquired Sight.io , a computer vision startup, in order to improve photo search and discovery using machine learning. If I\u2019m right about the direction the startup is moving in, taking the effort out of finding the right photos might be the factor that really puts EyeEm ahead of its old-school competition.

The latest contender is the Moto 360, a steel and leather beauty that launched today alongside the new Motorola X. Although I\u2019ve been duly impressed by the Samsung Gear series, you will immediately that the design language of the 360 is far more chic. Made of a round piece of coated steel and featuring a nice leather band and Gorilla Glass crystal, the watch looks more like a  Misfit Shine  than a nerd accouterment.  How does it work? Well, if you\u2019re not familiar with the vagaries of Android Wear, not very well at first. The interface consists of notifications that appear over the various watch faces available as well as a voice activated screen that allows you to ask for various pieces of information. You can ask Google for directions (delivered indirectly by your phone). You can ask it to take a note or send a text. You can look things up. You can also tell the time just by lifting your wrist. Unfortunately, the interface tends to dump back to the default time screen if something isn\u2019t understood, which is quite frustrating. Voice recognition has been consistently good, but sometimes it will activate too soon, resulting in something like \u201cOK Google Text OK Google\u201d appearing on the screen.

The  filing appeared on SEC.gov  today. 20.1 million shares will be on offer. Japanese investor Softbank currently owns 34 percent of the company while Yahoo owns 22 percent. The initial price is expected to hit at $60-66 per share with an initial valuation of up to $162 billion. At that valuation, Softbank\u2019s share of the firm is worth around $55 billion, and Yahoo\u2019s stake is worth more than $36 billion. In after-hours trading, Yahoo is up more than 1 percent, implying that investors in the American Internet giant are content with the Alibaba offering price range, but not surprised on the positive side. Yahoo ended the day worth just over $39 billion. Investors are therefore valuing Yahoo somewhat slimly when compared to the expected market value of its Alibaba shares. The proposed\u00a0valuation alone would make Alibaba and its subsidiary Taobao the second most valuable Internet company after Google. The  Wall Street Journal , however, is expecting a valuation of $155 billion, still far from shabby. You may now commence the pricing guessing game. Earlier  estimates pointed to a filing in last week in August , a slip of about a week from market expectations. Alibaba is a strange beast, an amalgam of Amazon and eBay. It does not actively hold inventory and instead connects buyers and sellers who complete the transaction. The IPO, if all else holds, could be the largest in history. Current investors are maintaining their stake in the company, although Yahoo will reduce its percentage slightly. The company is massive, and massively profitable \u2014 its revenue in its most recent quarter totaled $2.54 billion, with profits tipping the scale at just over $2 billion. The company\u2019s margins are therefore more than impressive. Investors have a keen eye on that metric. Yahoo\u2019s  shares sank  after Alibaba once reported a decrease in its operating margin. Alibaba\u2019s massive IPO will set records, and even dwarf the company\u2019s already large cash position of $16.97 billion, measured on\u00a0June 30 of this year. Investors are likely betting that Alibaba will continue not only its impressive profit margins, but also its quick topline growth. One metric to keep the pulse on when it comes to Alibaba is its number of active buyers on its platform: The company picked up 24 million between the March 31 of this year, and June 30, ending at a total of 279 million. As a final caveat, the Alibaba IPO can be viewed as a slight proxy on the Chinese economy.

Sounds like the startup has been busy since then \u2014 co-founder Zach Yungst told me that it has now served 5 million meals total, and that it\u2019s launching in four new cities, bringing the total to 10. Cater2.me\u2019s goal is to deliver a more varied, tasty catering experience by tapping into the varied culinary world you find in many cities. The company customers just enter the basics of how many people they\u2019re feeding, dietary restrictions, and when they need food \u2014 Cater2.me handles the rest of the logistics, making sure customers get deliveries from a rotating list of providers. In San Francisco, at least, that approach  attracted the business of a number of startups . (The TechCrunch HQ in San Francisco, however, has been fed by some competing services, including  ZeroCater  and  Zesty .) Five million meals is a big number, if a bit hard to wrap your head around. For a point of comparison, back in summer 2012,  Cater2.me said it had served about 800,000 of \u2018em . Yungst also told me the company is now serving \u201cin the five figure range daily\u201d (so, tens of thousands of meals a day). It employs more than 65 people, which is particularly impressive for a company that hasn\u2019t raised any outside funding. Oh, and the new markets are Seattle, LA, Houston, and Denver/Boulder. (In addition to SF, Cater2.me was already available in New York, Chicago, DC, Boston, and Austin.)

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/06/did-google-just-turn-the-phone-call-into-the-new-click/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:   Jason Spievak is the CEO of  Invoca .\u00a0 Remember when you had to pull out a phone book when you needed to contact a business for more information? Today, those yellow phone books get a quizzical look from my kids as we lug them directly to the recycle bin. These days, a few keystrokes and clicks allow us to conduct detailed research on a product and even complete our transactions online. This evolution has defined the information economy and turned Google into the money-making giant it is today. But despite the power of the click, the phone call has been getting a lot of attention lately. Case in point, Google recently announced one of the most meaningful advances in search since AdWords launched over a decade ago \u2014  Website Call Conversions . This new tool lets advertisers get the kind of attribution data for calls that Google has long provided for clicks. Given that the largest Internet company in the world is investing in product innovation for calls, it\u2019s inevitable that marketers are taking notice that voice is still highly relevant \u2014 and growing. In fact, the growth of mobile search is driving tens of billions of phone calls from consumers to businesses. So, call tracking in AdWords is a great start. But is it enough? Google isn\u2019t the only one focusing on calls. Twitter began  beta-testing click-to-call  earlier this year, and Facebook is rumored to add the function soon, enabling users to connect with businesses in the easiest way \u2014 directly over the phone. Twitter and Facebook are proving the value of advertising on their platforms by helping advertisers generate quantifiable results in the form of leads and sales, not just brand awareness and engagement. But why the resurgence in the seemingly \u201cold-school\u201d action of making a phone call? We all know that mobile is big. We use our phones for everything. In fact, next year it\u2019s expected that local search queries on mobile will outpace those on desktop. And Facebook just reported that more than half of its daily users connect exclusively on mobile, the channel where Facebook is experiencing nearly all of its revenue growth. But despite our addiction to mobile devices for getting our information and finding merchants, none of us like to click through multiple mobile web pages, thumb in our billing info, or fill out forms on a tiny screen. For significant or considered purchases \u2014 like insurance, credit cards, cars, trips, satellite TV, plumbers, restaurants, etc. \u2014 people want answers before pulling the purchase trigger. That\u2019s why we call businesses tens of billions of times each year. Google says that  70 percent of mobile searchers  have already connected directly with businesses from the search engine page using click-to-call. And according to  BIA/Kelsey , mobile search will generate more than 70 billion calls from consumers to businesses in 2018. So why should businesses care? While clicks to a website convert into customers about 1 to 2 percent of the time, inbound calls convert into customers 30 to 50 percent of the time, and typically at a higher average order value. The bottom line is that people are more likely to call when they\u2019re further along the purchase path \u2014 when they have questions or are ready to make a big purchase and want to complete the process with a human. Google\u2019s move to connect clicks and calls is arguably one of the most disruptive innovations in search because it\u2019s forcing marketers to re-think their playbooks. Attribution is no longer just about online channels. Offline matters, too. And as Facebook and Twitter build out their click-to-call solutions, the need for actionable intelligence around those calls will only continue to intensify (think marketing automation five years ago). It\u2019s time for marketers to think beyond the click.", "tags": "[\"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/shutterstock_92573179.jpg?w=738", "title": "Turning The Phone Call Into The New Click "},

Now, however,  Brian Krebs  has shown us just how the Feds found Ulbricht\u2019s server and, additionally, the pirate himself. A hole in the Silk Road\u2019s anonymity appeared because of a leaky CAPTCHA prompt.  CAPTCHA , as we all well know, is the little box that some sites use to prevent robots from filling out forms. If misconfigured, it will point to the server to which it is connected. On a non-anonymous server this would be a non-issue. However, Ulbricht\u2019s anonymous server was misconfigured and sent out the actual IP address of the Silk Road machines with every hit to the login page.  The government described their process in a  US District Court filing : \u201cThe Subject IP Address caught our attention because, if a hidden service is properly configured to work on Tor, the source IP address of traffic sent from the hidden service should appear as the IP address of a Tor node, as opposed to the true IP address of the hidden service, which Tor is designed to conceal. When I typed the Subject IP Address into an ordinary (non-Tor) web browser, a part of the Silk Road login screen (the CAPTCHA prompt) appeared. Based on my training and experience, this indicated that the Subject IP Address was the IP address of the SR Server, and that it was \u2018leaking\u2019 from the SR Server because the computer code underlying the login interface was not properly configured at the time to work on Tor.\u201d Is this real? As many have noted, there is some possibility that  Tor itself is compromised  and that this admission is a cover but, if Occam is to be believed, parsimony will out. In short, Ulbricht mixed anonymized and non-anonymous resources and misconfigured things to release his IP. One would presume this won\u2019t happen again as thousands of CAPTCHA prompts wink out of existence, but it shows just how hard it is to be completely invisible online.", "tags": "[\"tor\", \"ross ulbricht\", \"silk road\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/silk-road-anonymous-market-for-online-drug-dealing.jpg?w=738", "title": "The Feds Found The Silk Road\u2019s Ross Ulbricht Thanks To A Leaky CAPTCHA"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/06/so-many-platforms-so-few-developers/", "content": "As I walked around the  TechCrunch Disrupt\u00a0Hackathon  today, I talked to a lot of vendors who decided to set up tables at the event\u00a0for one reason: to lure developers to use their APIs and build applications on top of their platforms. In fact, I spoke to almost a dozen vendors including Evernote, Twitter, Microsoft Azure, The Weather Underground, Pearson (the book publisher), GoGo InFlight and many others. \u00a0I even spoke to a hospital representative who was there because they had built an open source hospital management platform, and you guessed it, they\u00a0were hoping to lure developers to join them and build applications on top of it. With so many platform plays out there though, it\u2019s exceedingly difficult for them all to achieve the necessary critical mass to get the developer attention they crave. The old chestnut holds of course. Just because you build it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll come. In fact, at a VC panel earlier this week at the  BoxWorks  customer conference,\u00a0 Rory O\u2019Driscoll from Scale Venture Partners  said, of course everyone wants to be a platform, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always a realistic goal. \u201cThird parties only engage when you achieve critical mass.\u00a0You have to do something else and become a platform.\u00a0You aren\u2019t born\u00a0fully formed as a platform.\u201d Using Box as an example, O\u2019Driscoll pointed out\u00a0enterprise file sync and share may be a commodity today, but it was considered pretty darn innovative in the 2009 timeframe and Box managed to get a lot people using the product. In turn, that got the attention of developers, precisely because they believed they could make money by building on top of Box. Today, Box claims to have 47,000 developers building applications on top of its platform. Without that critical mass, whatever that number happens to be, only a few people are\u00a0going to come, and so companies proactively try to attract developers to the platform by showing up at events like the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon, where\u00a0they have a large captive audience of developers at their disposal. And they are trying a number of strategies including offering cash and merchandize for the developers who write the most creative programs on their platforms. Many of the vendors are also holding free API workshops to help the developers who are interested in them get started or learn tips and tricks to make it easier to build applications. Some of the companies like Twitter, Yammer and Evernote of course have achieved that scale and companies are happily building on top of the platform for the very reasons that O\u2019Driscoll outlined. They know that if they build there, they have a huge potential audience, so the investment of time and resources is worth it. Yammer takes it a step further with its own startup incubator called the  Alchemist Accelerator  where they give developers $28K, access to additional funders, customers and mentors to help them build to their apps on top of Yammer, thereby developing a self-fulling cycle of developers wanting to build for them. As  Dana Evan from Jafco Ventures  said at that Box VC panel, one of the problems every technology\u00a0company faces today is the dearth of programming talent in the market and that\u2019s led to intense competition around hiring, and in turn to attract them to the platform each vendor is pushing so hard. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the competition for developer talent as fierce as it is today,\u201d she said. And that means you have a limited supply and great demand.\u00a0For platform players, it\u00a0means they have to work harder than ever to attract developers to build tools on top of their products. To paraphrase the old  Willy Nelson song , \u2018Mamas, you may want to\u00a0let their\u00a0babies grow up to be developers\u2019 because there\u2019s\u00a0crazy competition for their attention and that\u2019s a great place to be. In that context, today\u2019s Hackathon attendees all win.", "tags": "[\"platforms\", \"TechCrunch Disrupt\", \"hackathon\", \"Developer\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/hackathon.jpg?w=738", "title": "So Many Platforms, So Few Developers"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/06/barbarians-at-the-password-gate/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:   Igor Sill is managing director of  Geneva Venture Management . We\u2019re now using the Internet for a wide range of everyday activities, including online banking, stock trading, online shopping, bill paying, socializing, gaming, entertainment and online research.\u00a0 In the last few years there\u2019s been a massive growth in the number of social networking sites such as Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Craigslist, Instagram, Tumblr.\u00a0 We share all kinds of personal details on these sites as well as music, pictures and videos, most of which we would certainly prefer to protect, safeguard and keep private.\u00a0 Unfortunately, all of these sites have been \u201ccracked\u201d by hackers who exposed passwords and other personal information from thousands of users.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t had your password hijacked, it\u2019s really just a matter of time. Today you need to remember or store many passwords for all your online accounts, the list is endless. If you\u2019re like most, you use the same or very similar password for each account, essentially your password is only as secure as the weakest site you access with it when a hacker cracks that site, you then become victim of identity theft. The criminal who has stolen your personal data can use it to fraudulently obtain goods and services in your name. A hacker armed with the right password can get almost anything of yours including hijacking cloud-storage accounts, accessing your bank account, obtain credit cards in your name, apply for a new drivers license or passport in your name, then, simply steal money directly from your bank account. Identity theft is occurring more and more frequently, it happens to thousands every day. In addition to threats we face from website cracking, most of us have at some point had our smartphones and tablets misplaced, lost or stolen making it easier for these thieves to exploit our misfortune. According to the KPMG Data Loss Barometer, 1 billion\u00a0people have been affected by lost and stolen information in the last five years. Exposing ourselves Unfortunately, the more personal details we make available, the more exposed we become to online identity theft.\u00a0 Hackers can access your personal life\u2019s assets from anywhere on the globe with an internet connection, and from a virtually untraceable location.\u00a0 Hackers generally buy your password from data breaches. As you have probably already heard, a gang of Russian hackers, codenamed CyberVor, accomplished one of the biggest data breaches in history.\u00a0 CyberVor cracked 1.2 billion usernames and passwords, along with 540 million email addresses from 420,000 sites, according to Hold Security. More than likely, you\u2019re already using more than a few of those compromised sites. CyberVor will most likely sell that information on a per name, per account basis to individual hackers with criminal intent. These hacks are personally devastating and cost businesses billions of dollars every year. So, you probably need to start thinking about protecting yourself. The Hacker\u2019s Method One way that CyberVor may have stolen that much information is through SQL, the structured query language used by popular databases which is where most sites store user information. This was the method used by hackers to breach the retailer, Target. The number of data breaches so far this year represents a 20.5% increase over the same time period last year and continues to grow at an increased rate, says the Identity Theft Resource Center, in a  report  issued last week. \u00a0 Large-scale password cracking like CyberVor\u2019s is simply a process of exploiting system security flaws to recover passwords from stored data on your computer or other devices or running brute force attacks. However, the real trouble begins when groups like CyberVor sell the data they\u2019ve stolen to individual hackers. Let\u2019s say an individual hacker purchases your email password or one of your social network passwords. That hacker can use that particular account as a tool to exploit website account recovery methods for your other accounts. They\u2019ll initiate password reset and wait for the email to arrive, or use popular features like \u201cLogin with \u2018your favorite social network\u2019\u201d to access your other accounts. Once the hacker has reset your password, they\u2019re in charge and have full unauthorized access to your accounts, internet websites and sometimes your computer. With so many company websites being hacked this year, news of yet another major data breach seems routine.\u00a0 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s announcement this week that it may have been the target of a major cyber attack is a sign that hackers have found a way to breach one of the most protected computer systems in our economy. Successful breaches against financial institutions are unusual because banks have the strongest cyber security of any industry. JPMorgan Chase said it plans to spend $250 million on cyber security protection this year. Chase may have been breached through the negligence of one of its own employees, who personal computer was hacked in order to enter Chase\u2019s network, according to the Wall Street Journal. So, how secure are you with that secret password of yours, that singular protective word that\u2019s supposed to consist of both upper case, lower case string of alpha characters and numerics that you can barely remember? It\u2019s purposely so super secret because it\u2019s used to authenticate your identity so only you can gain access to your most treasured assets.\u00a0Its so difficult to remember that most will store their\u00a0passwords in their browser for convenience. The obvious problem with saving your difficult to remember passwords in your browser is that it\u2019s easy for someone who gains access to your computer to instantly access all your passwords. What happens when you do forget your password? Well there are ample, readily available solutions for retrieving forgotten passwords. Password cracking is generally a process of recovering/resetting passwords from stored data from your computer or other devices so as to recover the forgotten passwords, but of course, in the wrong hands it is conveniently used for gaining unauthorized access to your computer, accounts and internet websites. How easy is it to \u201ccrack\u201d your password? \u00a0In the \u201cold days\u201d thieves used software tools, such as Cain & Abel for cracking the password sequences (hash).\u00a0 This sort of tool used CPU core power for cracking and converting passwords into a plaintext form.\u00a0 So, assuming your password was complex and sufficiently strong (password which includes upper and lower case, alphanumeric and special characters), it would take many weeks and possibly years to process the plaintext from hash. Besides this method, there are other ways at a thief\u2019s disposal for password cracking such as by merely guessing your password (using your pet\u2019s name is a common mistake), by using tools such as keyloggers, phishing attacks, social engineering, dumpster diving, peeking over your shoulder, or of course, buying it directly from cyber thieves like CyberVor, etc.\u00a0 But of course, the easiest and most efficient is by use of easily downloadable freeware designed specifically to locate your password. There are many available online, Hashcat, Rainbow Crack, PWAudit, Accent RAR, and\u00a0a new super-fast password cracker developed by Ivan Golubev,\u00a0IGHashGPU, to name a few.\u00a0 Ivan\u2019s cracker tool can crack approximately 790 Million hashes per second, finding that hidden password in seconds.\u00a0\u00a0 Amazing. Defensive Measures So, it\u2019s important to create strong passwords that are different for each of your accounts and it\u2019s strongly recommended that you update those passwords regularly. Truth be known, password security depends heavily on the attack method.\u00a0 People often think that a short password of random characters such as \u201c+*4F#0$\u201d\u00a0 is super secure, but actually a long string of combined random words such as \u201cferrarimonkeydatemonger\u201d is actually far stronger. This added length causes uncertainty and is computationally more difficult to crack.\u00a0 Essentially, avoid real words that a hacker or cyber thief will find in a dictionary.\u00a0 And, certainly avoid the simple to remember, simple to crack: 123456, Iloveyou, 0000, Fido, etc. Stronger password security can be had via two-factor authentication (2FA) which split the password between two different systems and devices, making it very effective, but not perfect.\u00a0 It means that hackers need to crack two codes instead of one. A higher level, and dare I say, far more secure is the multi-factor authentication (MFA) being implemented by major software vendors, telecommunications, governments and financial institutions. Newer MFA solutions provide tokenless security and give formal verified proof by constantly shifting the user password. The MFA market is understandably growing at a feverish rate and expected to reach $5.5 Billion by 2017 according to Markets and Markets latest research report. Microsoft\u2019s newly released Office 365 products offers an advanced multi-factor authentication, Swivel Secure, as their safeguard to insure password security in the federated cloud. Of course, Microsoft and other vendors are even more concerned over enterprise wide security for large scale organizations, thus are evolving towards the data federation model which provides an organization with the ability to aggregate data from divergent sources so it can be used for all aspects of corporate business purposes.\u00a0 This federated model is especially useful for those organizations moving to the \u201ccloud\u201d. The next level of advanced password security is biometric authentication, essentially the process of determining whether someone is actually who they say they are via fingerprint or facial features. Of the many varieties of strong authentication options,  fingerprint biometrics  provides strong security, simplicity and user convenience. Fingerprint biometrics are indeed stronger because they cannot be easily faked, altered or stolen. If you\u2019re seriously concerned about your password, and you should be, strengthen it using the suggestions above or start using biometrics and/or multi-factor authentication as a company or as a user.\u00a0 You really need to be protected. \u00a0", "tags": "[\"Column\"]", "url_image": "", "title": "Barbarians At The Password Gate"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/05/monetization-automation-enforcement/", "content": "We\u00a0need no ghost to tell us something smells increasingly rotten in the state of social media. Facebook  forcing users to download a separate messaging\u00a0app  if they want to carry on IMing their friends. Twitter  polluting its users\u2019 carefully curated timelines  with content they did not choose\u00a0to read. Facebook  manipulating\u00a0the emotional cadence\u00a0of content  to figure out whether it can actively impact\u00a0users\u2019 emotions. Twitter\u00a0flirting with the idea of adding even  more algorithmically selected content into the timeline \u00a0\u2014\u00a0content that prioritizes what\u2019s\u00a0already\u00a0popular, and thus\u00a0mainstream, at the expense of\u00a0non-mainstream interests, nuance and minority views. Meanwhile, studies suggest the\u00a0majority of\u00a0Facebook users  are unaware  that\u00a0what\u00a0they\u00a0see in their newsfeed is not actually the sum total of their friends\u2019\u00a0news, but rather an algorithmic skim \u2014 biased for clickbait, stickiness\u00a0and, of course, advertising. There are a few clear themes to point to here that\u00a0can illuminate exactly where the rot stems from. The overarching theme\u00a0being\u00a0 monetization  \u2014 or,\u00a0more specifically, increasing\u00a0external\u00a0pressure to monetize these social\u00a0services. Both Facebook and Twitter are free at the point of use, yet are publicly traded companies, answerable to shareholders and investors. That inevitably drives a\u00a0need to achieve mainstream scale\u00a0and mass\u00a0engagement to deliver the kind of returns their shareholders expect. User growth has been a particular problem for Twitter . It\u2019s not an easy network to understand in the short term \u2014 which has undoubtedly retarded its growth. But, like all things of lasting value, effort expended over a longer time period leads to refined\u00a0reward. It\u2019s no accident that long-time Twitter users genuinely\u00a0 love  the service.\u00a0I am one of them. I\u00a0signed up in August\u00a02008 and have been\u00a0tweeting ever since. It\u2019s the only digital service I feel any kind of emotional attachment to.\u00a0Conversely, you don\u2019t have to search\u00a0for long to find long-time\u00a0Facebook users expressing \u00a0the opposite\u00a0sentiment . Technically I am also a long-time Facebook user,\u00a0joining the service back in April 2007. But I don\u2019t think of myself in those terms \u2014 and certainly wouldn\u2019t identify as one. I\u2019m still on Facebook, largely\u00a0for work purposes or to use Facebook as an identity layer for other apps and services, but I am  not actively engaged with Facebook . I rarely post anything, log in only sporadically, and \u2014 despite Facebook\u2019s\u00a0position as the undisputed leader of social media services with  more than 1\u00a0billion active monthly users  \u2014 feel zero\u00a0 personal \u00a0attachment to it. If Facebook disappeared\u00a0tomorrow I would barely notice its absence (except perhaps in a welcome sense via\u00a0the sudden lack of spam emails), even though every time I do sign in there\u2019s an automatically populated feed of social content just waiting for my eyeballs to lock on \u2014 and that\u2019s pretty impressive, given\u00a0how little effort I expend\u00a0on using Facebook. But if Twitter, the human-curated information network, ceased to exist? Well, it doesn\u2019t bear thinking about\u2026 The thing is, effort does not scale well online. People have become conditioned to expect convenience; to expect to have the hard work done for them. The rise of mobile usage has hugely fueled this mentality \u2014 making it even more imperative for a digital service to be hyper simple to set up and use. If it doesn\u2019t \u2018just work\u2019 within a matter of seconds it likely won\u2019t get\u00a0used at all. Although I don\u2019t have to spend very much time at all maintaining my Twitter feed now, with six years invested in the service, that\u2019s exactly because I have spent multiple years figuring out who it\u2019s worth my while following (and who not). Sure there are undoubtedly\u00a0plenty of folk on Twitter who I haven\u2019t found yet who could expand my network in new and interesting\u00a0ways. But\u00a0you can\u2019t usefully follow every interesting person (whatever\u00a0 Robert Scoble \u00a0says). And, more importantly,\u00a0I don\u2019t trust an algorithm that\u2019s geared towards maximizing business profits to identify interesting\u00a0people on my behalf. That algorithm would be working for Twitter\u2019s shareholders, not\u00a0for my brain. Bottom line: who I choose\u00a0 not\u00a0 to follow is as core a part of why Twitter is so useful to me as those accounts I do add to my follow list. Also worth emphasizing: human time and attention span are finite, so any digital service\u00a0that\u00a0steers\u00a0you\u00a0away from the things you are actively\u00a0interested in\u00a0for its own profit-making ends\u00a0is acting\u00a0parasitically. Now obviously most people\u00a0aren\u2019t going to invest multiple years\u2019 worth of their time into making a digital service really special and useful to\u00a0them. Mainstream scale demands a self-organizing\u00a0system\u00a0that takes that sort of effort away. Which brings me to another theme here: increasing\u00a0 automation , and thus decreasing human (end-user) control. Automation has plentiful business benefits. It lowers costs over the long term\u00a0because it\u2019s\u00a0autonomous; set it going and it steamrollers on, letting the business owners sit back and watch the data (and money) roll in. Yes automation is linked intrinsically to monetization. Automation\u00a0can also be granularly controlled via algorithmic levers. It\u00a0invites and even\u00a0encourages this sort of mass tweaking. It\u2019s a\u00a0digital Petri dish that becomes a natural playground\u00a0for\u00a0A/B testing. A\u00a0business can\u00a0clinically figure out how to maximize factors\u00a0such as user engagement or ad views just by running a couple of new algorithmic recipes and comparing the results \u2014 selecting whichever one maximizes its bottom line\u00a0and discarding any\u00a0that don\u2019t. Minority concerns are quashed by this process logic. Such experiments aren\u2019t about\u00a0reintroducing the human nuance\u00a0that an algorithmic approach inevitably flattens; they just optimize core algorithms for particular business outcomes: page views, stickiness, user engagement, and so on.\u00a0And for the overarching business imperative: profit. (Not for nothing that  publicly traded corporations have been compared to\u00a0sociopaths .) Automation is certainly a marvel. But it\u2019s not without cost. And to pretend otherwise \u2014 to pretend that there is no difference between an autonomously provisioned service and one with human brains actively influencing what\u2019s seen and surfaced \u2014 is just plain wrong.\u00a0It may be that in future, AI-powered automation closes that \u2018uncanny valley\u2019 gap, by being able to\u00a0act in a way that\u2019s almost indistinguishable from human decisions. But we\u2019re not there yet. And we\u2019re likely a very very  very  long way away from that collapsed singularity.\u00a0Finally, within the odorous\u00a0passageways\u00a0of our\u00a0modern\u00a0social media citadels, we stumble upon\u00a0another theme:  enforcement . Slowly but surely the freedoms\u00a0that initially drew\u00a0us into these glittering social spaces\u00a0are\u00a0being withdrawn, as\u00a0barred gates drop\u00a0into place \u2014 limiting\u00a0our usage options, and controlling and constraining\u00a0the social content\u00a0we see. The walled gardens shrink,\u00a0getting narrower in outlook as the logic of their underlying content-filtering algorithms becomes evident. The business advantage of limiting what users can do\u00a0is that user\u00a0behavior\u00a0can be better channeled and predicted.\u00a0We the users become lab rats forced to eyeball\u00a0whatever is placed\u00a0in front of us.\u00a0Many people won\u2019t even realize exactly how staged and contrived their digital social services\u00a0have\u00a0become, as they are encouraged to keep\u00a0scrolling mindlessly through all the\u00a0tasty looking, populist clickbait fired at their eyeballs. Yet the original promise of a free social\u00a0space is\u00a0reduced to the singleminded grind\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0hamster wheel \u2014 a wheel whose\u00a0speed is determined\u00a0not by the user choosing to hop off and on, but by a pace-optimizing profit-maximizing machine concealed behind its\u00a0walls. Automation is also a type of enforcement. It has to be. It implies a lack of choice stemming from the lack of a human hand steering things. Control is taken away from humans and handed over\u00a0to what are (for now) human written algorithms. And the power of algorithms to manipulate\u00a0the behavior of an entire user population can evidently be corrupting. Witness  Facebook\u2019s consent-less emotional experiment . Enforcement can apparently lead to a service investigating\u00a0whether it\u00a0can enforce or inculcate a particular sentiment\u00a0among its users  just to see if it can . This is awful but hardly surprising, given that advertising as a category seeks to enforce a choice \u2014 to override our human free will to decide on something without any outside influence by lathering on the shiny, opinion-massaging\u00a0snake oil \u2014 so it\u2019s a natural next step for social services whose business models are built on ad clicks to seek to enforce more and more of the decisions of their user populations. Such as, for instance,  Twitter polluting users\u2019 timelines  with content from accounts that they are not following \u2014 and offering no opt-out for this \u2018feature\u2019. But hey, once you have lured enough non-paying users onto your service, why then it\u2019s time to make \u2018em dance to the tune of your advertisers, right? Facebook and Twitter are indeed free at the point of use. And the hackneyed tech maxim runs that \u2018if it\u2019s free you\u2019re the product\u2019. And yes it follows that if you\u2019re the product then you\u2019re not an agent involved  in  the service but\u00a0a unit\u00a0opted in to being manipulated  by  the service.\u00a0The service\u00a0views you as a\u00a0controllable commodity to be stacked and\u00a0positioned, pushed and steered. To be moved\u00a0howsoever the business sees fit in order\u00a0to achieve its goal of greater profits. But there is a problem with that logic. Thing is, without us human users of these social services there would be no Facebook and no Twitter. Without millions and even billions of\u00a0people\u00a0freely producing and uploading content there would be no social media palaces at all.\u00a0Their\u00a0passageways would be empty,\u00a0devoid of content, lifeless. There really would be nothing to see here. It can be difficult to decry social media\u2019s inexorable shift towards algorithmically curated info-feeds on the grounds that these businesses\u00a0need to drive usage to please\u00a0their investors. After all that is how\u00a0publicly traded companies operate. The motive is\u00a0continued profit growth, and bigger\u00a0profits demands more users, and getting more users requires becoming more mainstream. In this blind drive for exponential scale the individual user loses all meaning, and has zero value to the business. The business now concerns itself with handling\u00a0massive blocks of users \u2014 and of course algorithms are better at handling\u00a0segmented groups that sit within monetizeable buckets.\u00a0Algorithms are  born \u00a0designed to perform\u00a0that sort of\u00a0heavy lifting. But there is certainly a moral argument that says services like Twitter\u00a0are betraying the very individuals\u00a0whose efforts built their businesses\u00a0in the first place. The people who\u00a0invested the\u00a0time and effort that allowed the service\u00a0to scale large\u00a0enough to be able to IPO. Not that sociopathic corporations\u00a0compute the logic of\u00a0moral arguments, of course. Another point worth making: It can be rather difficult to articulate exactly why\u00a0a service like Twitter can feel so\u00a0alive, when \u2014 conversely \u2014 Facebook, an apparently similar social service, can leave you feeling cold, suckered in, used and abused. Or indeed just bored by homogeneity. But actually it\u2019s really\u00a0rather a simple distinction: one is the product of\u00a0a single human mind;\u00a0the other is the product of an algorithm.\u00a0Twitter, as it (mostly) is now with users in the driving seat, is a service with a human soul. While Facebook, which long ago prioritized algorithmic logic over human choices, is\u00a0just another mechanized\u00a0process. Sure Facebook is\u00a0dressed up to look familiar and human,\u00a0thanks to its ability to surface\u00a0the faces and\u00a0photos\u00a0of your friends. But really there\u2019s nothing behind that mask but a profit-maximizing imperative. Celebrity\u00a0gossip, viral videos, wedding announcements, and an unending carousel of\u00a0baby photos\u2026\u00a0 Welcome to the mainstream logic of AlgorithmVille!

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/06/netflix-vs-verizon-vs-consumer-can-everyone-win/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0 Dror Gill is CTO of\u00a0 Beamr ,\u00a0an imaging technology company that powers web publishers, digital distributors, social networks and media companies\u00a0and focuses on\u00a0reducing costs associated with storing and transmitting media files.\u00a0 Today\u2019s consumer is streaming more video than ever before. Netflix alone has increased its subscribers by more than 20 million in the past two years, totaling 50 million subscribers as of  Q2 2014 . It\u2019s no wonder, then, that the increase in video consumption is not without consequences for streaming services and ISPs. The news media has recently highlighted a drawn-out dispute between Verizon and Netflix, with Netflix blaming Verizon for its congested network and failing to provide the consistent bandwidth required to enable a high-quality service for Netflix customers. Netflix even  sent messages  to its customers blaming their poor experience on Verizon\u2019s networks. Source:  Yuri Victor Eventually, Verizon  filed a cease and desist  that forced Netflix to withdraw these messages, with Verizon blaming Netflix for continued traffic problems due to its limited choice of transit providers.Verizon\u2019s VP of regulatory affairs, David Young, even showed the following diagram in a  blog post , claiming there is no congestion on Verizon\u2019s own network, only on the link from Netflix to Verizon through their choice of transit providers. Source: Verizon The debate has continued with Netflix claiming that Verizon should upgrade its connectivity to these transit providers to solve the bottleneck issue. Young  immediately replied  that Netflix should use paid peering and pay Verizon for the inbound traffic flowing into its network. And the battle goes on. This dispute is just the beginning of the Internet bottleneck issue. Not only do on-demand video services such as YouTube and Netflix now account for over 50 percent of all North American Internet traffic, but Cisco recently reported in its  Visual Networking Index  report that by 2018, video will comprise a whopping 79 percent of global consumer Internet traffic. Whether or not streaming services and ISPs eventually sign peering agreements to settle the disputes, there are still several possible solutions to the video bandwidth problem. An obvious one is to reduce video bitrates in order to lower the bandwidth requirements of the streamed video files. However, because video quality is directly related to the bitrate allocated to the video stream, blindly lowering the bitrate will result in a poor viewing experience and unsatisfied customers\u2014an option that is unacceptable in the age of retina displays and UHD 4k televisions. Another solution is caching the most frequently viewed video files at the network edges. This ensures that when a popular video file is being requested by a user, it can be streamed from a location that is close to the user\u2019s physical location, and does not have to travel again over the Internet backbone. Since most of the online video traffic is generated by a relatively small number of popular streams, caching those streams can be cost-effective when taking into account the storage costs of the cached files vs. the delivery costs of each copy that travels over the network. Adaptive bitrate streaming is another common solution used by content delivery networks. This method detects a user\u2019s bandwidth and CPU capacity in real time, then adjusts the quality of a video stream accordingly to prevent overloading a user\u2019s connection with more bitrate than it can handle. While this strategy incurs additional storage and encoding costs, it can eliminate buffering and provide consistent streaming on both high-end and low-end connections. Finally, there\u2019s media optimization, which takes an already-compressed video stream, analyzes its perceptual properties, and encodes it to a lower bitrate to increase streaming speeds without affecting the original video quality. This would be like taking a ball of modeling clay and squeezing it to make it smaller: It still has the same amount of clay, but occupies a smaller amount of space. Some forms of media optimization may struggle to maintain the quality of the video while reducing file size, but when done correctly using a reliable perceptual quality measure, this process can reduce a bitrate and file size by 20-50 percent while retaining the full perceptual quality. While these major players continue to sort through the congestion issues, utilizing current solutions like caching, adaptive bitrate streaming and media optimization can alleviate the bandwidth bottleneck problem while providing a win-win-win situation for content providers, telcos and end users.", "tags": "[\"Netflix\", \"Verizon\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/shutterstock_147888416.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/beamr_netflix-verizon.png?w=901&h=415 https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/beamr_netflix-verizon1.png?w=680&h=526", "title": "Netflix Vs.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/facebook-privacy-checkup/", "content": "The top gripe about Facebook is that people don\u2019t know who they\u2019re sharing with, so in the coming days Facebook will push everyone through a multi-step  privacy checkup  that reminds who they share statuses with, what apps they\u2019ve given permissions, and what\u2019s visible on their profile. A cutesy blue dinosaur will lead people through the process which was originally  tested in March  but is now getting shown to everyone. Some users will undoubtedly find the procedure annoying, even if its well-intentioned and they need it. They\u2019ll be able to skip it but will get prompted again later. For now the tool is only on the web, which means a huge chunk of users won\u2019t see it until a mobile version is developed later. If Facebook can get users to endure the little chore while making them more confident about who they share with, they might be willing to post more frequently and wider range of content to the social network. In a bit of self-deprecation that shows Facebook\u2019s aware of the dodgy perception of its privacy, the company writes \u201cWe know you come to Facebook to connect with friends, not with us.\u201d That\u2019s funny, since everything you share is in fact shared with Facebook for the purpose of personalization and ad targeting, even if its only robots and not humans that see your content. The constantly changing settings and defaults make it tough to keep track of who sees what, but the checkup only hits the biggest settings and many smaller ones are still out there to confuse people. The privacy checkup will pop up overlaid on the web homescreen when you login sometime in the near future. The posts checkup highlights if you\u2019re sharing to the feeds of friends, a custom set of people, or everyone, and how to toggle the setting from the status composer. The apps step shows all the apps you\u2019ve given Facebook permissions, and lets you manage what personal data about you the apps can access. Finally, you\u2019ll be shown the visibility of your current city, work history, and education shown on your profile. This also serves Facebook nicely by reminding you to keep this info up to date, which lets it target you with ads. So far, it\u2019s been way too easy for users to accidentally leave the status composer set to public and inadvertently overshare things that could jeopardize their integrity in the eyes of potential hirers, or expose them to stalking by Internet weirdos. This adorable tyrannosaurus is oddly fitting mascot for Facebook\u2019s privacy team. Something that seems friendly and innocuous, but that grows more powerful by devouring your data. The privacy checkup won\u2019t make up for a decade of dicey privacy, but it\u2019s a dinosaur-sized step in the right direction.", "tags": "[\"facebook privacy\", \"Facebook\", \"Social\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/privacy-checkup-dinos.png?w=680 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/privacycheckupstep1.jpg?w=680&h=671 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/privacycheckupstep2.jpg?w=680&h=528", "title": "Facebook To Re-Educate All Users With A Privacy Checkup On Their Posts, Apps, And Profiles"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/elon-musk-is-right-burning-man-is-silicon-valley/", "content": "Burning man is both an intrinsic part of Silicon Valley and a DJ party in the desert. It\u2019s a place where folks are free to run around in sparkles and spandex and leather and nothing, covered in dust. A place for rich people to party and nude hippies to dance around the fire. But most of all it\u2019s an experimental prototype for human technological possibility in the middle of nowhere that stands on the principle of radical acceptance of everyone. And it\u2019s not easy to explain an entire city full of nearly 70,000 different people. But for the curious, allow me to try. It\u2019s nighttime when my driving buddy Ben Parr and I arrive in Black Rock. It\u2019s been a long 8 hour journey from San Francisco to Gerlach, with another 5 hours on top of that waiting in the long line to get in the gates. Someone in line ahead of us tells us this line is actually short. Greeters in long white robes welcome us \u201chome\u201d at the\u00a0Burning Man gates and direct us to yet another long line of cars. We were the lucky few who escaped the storm that left thousands on the side of the road for 18 hours. Already camp mates have been working hard to erect a giant shade structure, kitchen, water and power supplies when Ben drops me off at my camp around 10 pm. My camp, Ideate, is made up of carefully selected innovators, startup founders, VC\u2019s and the tech reporters who cover them (Reporters from VentureBeat, Re/code, Fast Company and TechCrunch are all in this camp). As my tent mate,  Shauna Causey , put it, \u201cIdeate is full of founder do-gooder types.\u201d Causey sold her last company Decide.com to  eBay  and has served as VP at  Startup Weekend . Another camper, Doc North has his own tech show \u201c In the Making \u201d on the YouTube Discovery Channel network. Tim West, part of the camp leadership crew, is a former Facebook chef and co-created the  Future of Food Hackathon . \u201cIs there room for me?\u201d I ask, pointing to a spot at a table in camp next to an older gentleman. He welcomes me in and tells me his name is  Raj Sandhu , a VC from San Francisco. He\u2019s not in our camp but bought into the Hare Krishna vegan meal plan offered here. Sandhu and I exchange the regular chit chat about our daily experiences around Black Rock City \u2014 the very tall man in the big combat boots dancing in front of a giant purple penis structure, our favorite art cars \u2013 mine is the golden dragon Viking ship, the monkey chanting workshop, whether we\u2019ve gone inside the Orgy Dome or not (there\u2019s an orgy dome and it is what you think it is). It\u2019s both of our first time here. Neither of us can help but notice how intrinsically intertwined tech is to the art and experience of this event. \u201cGo out into deep playa,\u201d Sandhu tells me, \u201cyou\u2019ll see this structure that can be manipulated with an iPhone.\u201d Deep playa sits way out in the distance of Black Rock City, about a couple miles from where everyone\u2019s set up camp. Large art structures, several with LED lights, digital displays and other technical work pop up out of this dusty wasteland in every direction. The desert festival has a rep as something for dirty hippies on drugs to many who\u2019ve never gone. It\u2019s been a surprise to hear of the Silicon Valley element in the last few years. Now mentions of technorati on the playa seems so commonplace it\u2019s hardly worth the mention. Google\u2019s  Larry Page  and  Sergey Brin  have been coming to Burning Man consistently for well over a decade. The first  Google doodle  was an homage to The Man. Amazon\u2019s  Jeff Bezos  and  Mark Zuckerberg  have made the trek.  Drew Houston , co-founder of  Dropbox  camped out this year and  Alexis Ohanian  from  Reddit  was there as well. Fire Dancer performs out on the playa at Black Rock City. Still, other tech leaders chose to stay away this time around. Tech titan  Elon Musk  didn\u2019t go. He, notably, came up with the idea for  SolarCity while at Burning Man  a few years back, then gave the concept to his cousins. Musk\u2019s people declined to comment as to why he chose not to attend this year\u2019s festivities. Box co-founder Aaron Levie joked on Twitter that he was ahead of the curve for not going. At some point, *not* going to Burning Man will be perceived as more hardcore than going, and I'll be way ahead of the curve.\u2014  Aaron Levie (@levie)  August 24, 2014 Attendance was down overall this year by a few thousand people, according to the latest 2014 Burning Man Census Report. Those numbers are from a census insider and not officially published yet. Friday\u2019s official peak attendance was at 65,922, below the Bureau of Land Management cap of 68,000 and the projected 70,000 attendance for this year. It should also be noted that BMIR, the official radio station of Black Rock City,  reported  that 10,000 people had already left the city before the man burned. Part of this non-attendance could have been because of the  earlier rain fiasco  or the rumors that Burning Man had been canceled. And perhaps part of the early exodus had to do with Jack U\u2019s (aka Diplo and Skrillex)  poor choices  during a set at Robot Heart. While a lot of people ask who came, that\u2019s not the focus for everyone. I\u2019m chatting about who\u2019s who with my tent mates when a guy comes in and sits down in our tent and then screams that he doesn\u2019t care who anybody is and can I please put down my phone and turn off my walkie talkie. It does not occur to him that he is in my tent or that both objects are a necessity for me as a reporter. But as a counselor at  Camp Grounded , a summer camp where adults go to purposely unplug, it makes sense that my use of tech while camping would annoy him. Others just accept tech as part of the overall experience here. \u201cBurning Man is tech,\u201d a woman named Wolf tells me as we wait in line for the Dr. Bronner\u2019s foam party \u2013 a much lauded naked group shower experience at Burning Man for the past several years. Wolf, a former tech entrepreneur turned fire dancer, has been coming to the burn since 2005. \u201cBut don\u2019t the tech elites ruin the burn for others?\u201d I ask her. Wolf pauses, pulls out a pasty zinc sunscreen and plasters her lips in white before thoughtfully replying. \u201cLook, the spirit of Burning Man is innovation. We wouldn\u2019t have any of this without tech. It started with people in San Francisco and that\u2019s what brings all this out here. And besides,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes, \u201cLarry Harvey\u2019s camp is the original plug n\u2019 play.\u201d Plug n\u2019 play refers to camps that have everything set up for you before you arrive, right down to chefs making your food and your living space already arranged. I talk about startups a lot, but usually not naked. Yet here I am discussing Yerdle, Facebook and Freespace while waiting to get blasted by Dr. Bronners soap foam in a giant box with 50 other dusty weirdos. It\u2019s the perfect collision of Silicon Valley and Burning Man. Both are part of that spirit of challenging the status quo, innovation and self-reliance that embodies startup culture. Burning Man started with a bad breakup. Harvey, the co-founder, built a small structure resembling a man and burned it on Baker Beach in San Francisco 28 years ago. It was a symbolic gesture to help him get over the heartache and symbolically burn away his old self. The festival has since moved to the Nevada desert and has grown to an attendance of nearly 70,000 people annually. It doesn\u2019t seem like the tech elites are ruining it for burners as much as the so-called \u201crich people camps.\u201d Talk of their existence irks many burners this year. Still others share in the Burning Man principle of radical inclusion for all, rich or not. I put up a simple question on the Burning Man Facebook Group about whether the rich people camps affect the burn experience or not. It had 168 strongly worded opinions at last count. A bald man dripping with silver body paint who came to visit Ideate mentions one such camp to me, way out on the edge of town. He was a late addition to the camp he claims costs $25,000 or more for each member to join, though he was \u201cgifted\u201d his spot, \u201cWe get fresh sushi flown in every day and our own Segways,\u201d he brags. Curious, I wander over with my aforementioned tall, blond tent mate to see what this camp is all about. The camp is hard to find at first. A bartender/fruit smoothie maker at the camp in front of it pours a ginger carrot mixture into my cup. Her camp, Lost and Found Hotel, looks swanky enough. Each camp mate has individual canvas pods to sleep in and there\u2019s a front desk check-in. She tells me it\u2019s mostly made up of builders and artists in her camp. It\u2019s nice, sure, but not a $25,000 glamp camp. Not anything like the camp we are about to see. She points the two of us to an ornate Middle Eastern looking structure hidden behind a bunch of semi trucks in the back. \u201cSeriously, go take a look, you have to go see it,\u201d she tells us. \nI quickly find that, contrary to  other   reports , the camp is not a private, walled-in place only available to rich kids. We walk right in and are offered fresh fruit and beer. But it is definitely where the rich kids stay.\u00a0Plush couches and giant bean bags are placed about for anyone to lounge in. I ask a gal at the bar how much everyone paid to stay here. \u201cOh easily $25k,\u201d she tells me. She is a member of the camp and not paid to bartend. Some of the camp members are entrepreneurs or in tech, she confirms. The vast majority of them are from the LA entertainment scene, though. She lets me know everyone here pitches in and takes shifts\u2026but yes they do have a kitchen staff hidden\u00a0behind the camp, making meals for them every day. The camp also comes complete with hotel-style walled off glamp tents with coolers in them for each of the members. Causey and I peak inside to find fluffy pillows and white comforters await each guest. Segways are available to each member for easy use and many camp mates flew in on private jets \u2013 all part of the package. The main bar is lined with top shelf vodka. An ornate DJ stage hangs above. Causey asks for a drink at the bar from a petite woman wearing false eyelashes and a corset. She\u2019s told that the \u201cgood stuff\u201d is for camp members only. Okay, so not everything is available to just anyone here. We are once again directed to the fresh fruit and beer. There was also free water, electrolytes and coffee in back. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s funny, these camps want to experience Burning Man but by coming in and having everything planned for them they deny themselves the actual experience,\u201d says an older gentleman who goes by David Magic Hands. He\u2019s been coming to Burning Man with the HeeBeeGeeBee Camp for the last 16 years and runs a retreat devoted to female orgasm in Costa Rica. His orgasmic wisdom is his gift to the playa. \u201cWhat are these kinds of camps giving back?\u201d he asks me. People do as people do with their opinions about the \u201cother.\u201d Especially on social media. Bill Bo posted his experience with the so-called \u201crich people\u201d on the same Burning Man Facebook group: A fancy schmancy high end bus camper was headed down Darjeeling on Thursday morning as we were having our morning coffee on the crackly fresh playa lawn out front. The driver waved. I asked the universe for beer. He stopped, walked around to the supply bay, reached in there and got us a 30 pack of Miller High Life beer. We gave him one of our Burner shirts from the free box we had in front of our camp. I think we can all get along. Rich camps seem relative in a place that, at minimum, costs the average attendee at least $1000 to go. The ticket just to get in is about $393.50 with tax, then there\u2019s camp dues, food, water, camping supplies, costumes, travel. Over $56 million Burning Man dollars were pumped into Nevada last year, up nearly $11 million from the year before, according to event organizers. Of course $4.5 million of that goes to the Bureau of Land Management and another $10 million is estimated to be spent on airport travel. The average burner reported spending at least $250 in last minute camping supplies, food and water in Nevada, according to the  2012 Census . Looking out from the middle of the playa one night near a ginormous LED-lined structure of the word \u201cLOVE,\u201d Ryan Parks, co-founder of Sacred Media, relays how important it is to him that tech leaders, rich people and others get this experience anyway, \u201cThis is the height of human luxury and I think most people would twist that to make that a bad thing, but this is a great experiment in self-actualization. You can see it when you look around at the amazing works of art that people are driving around. This is where we see human ingenuity and creativity at it\u2019s finest,\u201d says Parks. \u201cSilicon Valley is a lot like this,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s the epicenter of the makers of the world. And the makers will remake the world in the digital age.\u201d Credit: Jim Urquhart, Reuters Whether it\u2019s a sign of the times or the influx of more tech workers at Burning Man, this human ingenuity has brought with it some modernizations this year. There\u2019s cell service now, BRC organizers have placed four cell towers for texting within the city. There are apps like \u201cTime to Burn\u201d and \u201ciBurn\u201d to help you schedule your favorite events. Facebook friends can find each other using the Facebook  Burner Map  app. Some camps offer wifi and one even has a solar powered steam room. My own camp organized a speaker series. Giant Buddha statues greeted burners as they wandered into camp to hear about building cities of the future, robots and government. Uhuru is another Burning Man camp made up of mainly San Francisco founders that broke off from Camp Ideate to create their own tech innovators group on the playa. Dennis Kucinich showed up for his talk in a blue dress shirt and khakis \u2013 surely setting him apart amongst a crowd of spandex and sparkly things. Going by his playa name, \u201cCharge,\u201d Kucinich discussed privacy, government surveillance and marijuana legalization. Libertarian-leaning Republican Grover Norquist, who came to Burning Man for the first time this year, was also scheduled to speak at Ideate, but rumor was he had to cancel his appearance because of threats. While it seems there\u2019s still some work to do on the radical inclusion front, just the fact that a man who once ran for president, a major political representatives and even a speaker series now at Burning Man is a bit of a jolt to me. This is not the Burning Man I had pictured, full of bad DJ\u2019s and acid tripping hippies.  TEDx  held its own series in the \u201cspirit of ideas worth spreading.\u201d There were Reddit meetups, bitcoin meetups, the FauxMirage camp, home of the Dr. Bronner\u2019s foam party, held its own lecture series on cannabis and psychedelics as medicine. Did it bother people that Dr. Bronner\u2019s was commercially mentioned? Someone had asked me to cover the logo on my own drinking cup earlier. Any type of branding is frowned upon here. Dr. Bronner\u2019s seems to get a pass. The camp doesn\u2019t advertise itself as the name brand, though everyone knows it as such. The half-naked guy in a pony tail at the front of the line corrects me when I ask about the camp brand. \u201cI have no idea what you are talking about,\u201d he says, then nods to the camp\u2019s signage. \u201cThis is FauxMirage.\u201d But everyone knows it as the Dr. Bronner\u2019s camp anyway. \nEveryone talks about the drugs, the parties, the music, and the tech elites at Burning Man. What people don\u2019t really mention before you go is that there is Burning Man the festival and then there\u2019s Burning Man the religious experience. The beautiful, brain stimulating art, LED lights, costumes (or lack thereof), the mind-numbing throb of constant music and drum beats pulsing through your entire body, the openness, the love, the incessant hugging and the lack of a true night\u2019s sleep all combine to bring about this wildish mental state observable in even the most curmudgeonly soul. You take all that with you, go to the temple structure way out past The Man and start reading all these messages left about regrets, sanity, suicide attempts or loved ones who\u2019ve died and tell me you wouldn\u2019t lose it. It happens. You can hear the sobs among the quiet reverence within the intricately cut wood walls. I almost lost it here, too but didn\u2019t. That would come later. I did take some time to reflect on my younger brother,  killed in a hiking accident 11 years ago . I thought about his soul and mine and I felt a reverence for the whole human race in that moment. One single tear ran down my dusty cheek and then I was done. It\u2019s tough to truly describe this moment until you\u2019ve been there, though. That\u2019s for both Burning Man and the death of a sibling. You just don\u2019t get it till you are there. Theres a lot of weddings, engagements and commitment ceremonies to crash at Burning Man. So many folks get married at dawn or sunset at the Temple they have to choose different areas on the outside for their individual events. Photogs and onlookers line up to see the bride and groom or groom and groom or bride and bride\u2026or just the bride. The famous-for-being-tech-famous  Julia Allison did marry herself  this year. I crashed an engagement ceremony of one of the Ideate founders. About a hundred of us sat on the dirt carpet, dressed in our finest feathers and leather and lace and whatever else we felt like while he and his bride-to-be relayed how they stood in a rushing river one day, buck naked, wild horses running in the background, as he knelt down on one knee and asked her to be his forever. Both his parents and a new age priest were there to support them. It made me pause. People actually live this way in a weird, wonderful hippie fairy tale, surrounded by a loving community of family and friends. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep or that my mind had been overstimulated for the last 5 days straight, but it was there that I broke down and actually, embarrassingly, bawled my eyes out. I wanted that weird and wonderful thing that just happened and I now knew that somewhere in the universe this existed. You can\u2019t help but be changed by Burning Man. Black Rock City is neatly laid out in a half disc with roads marked in time like 2:00, 2:30, 3:00 and so on until you get to 10:00. It criss-crosses alphabetical intersections from Antioch to K. You say \u201cMeet up at Darjeeling and 9:00\u2033 as the address. It boasts two public libraries (yes, you can actually check out books during your time on the playa), a media center, police station, bars, clubs, pop-up restaurants serving poutine and grilled cheese sandwiches and even a makeshift medical unit complete with high-tech X-ray machines to check for broken bones and other maladies. It\u2019s a truly free form of healthcare, paid for by your Burning Man ticket. \u201cMaking things is critical to innovation,\u201d says Debra Costa, CIO for the city of San Leandro. She\u2019s referring to the creation and innovation created in the temporary city that is Burning Man. She came to Black Rock City\u00a0for the first time this year to study the kinds of innovation and rapid prototyping that happens on the playa in order to bring that same idea back to her own town. \u201cSan Leandro is a lab city,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we are going to innovate we have to learn to do it on the fly, just like at Burning Man.\u201d Costa and her colleague Michael Caplan, Berekley\u2019s economic development manager and a burner since 1998, agree with Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk when he said \u201cBurning Man is Silicon Valley.\u201d \u201cHis idea for the Hyperloop from San Francisco to LA is a paradigm shift,\u201d says\u00a0Caplan. \u201cWhat Elon was referring to is every region has a different genomic footprint. That type of ethos is not about how much money is in your venture fund, but has to do with your belief systems or religion of the place.\u201d says Greg Horowitt, a first time burner and a Silicon Valley VC. \u201cThere is a religion, a social contract in play here. You come into Burning Man knowing that your values align with the values of the people here and it\u2019s all about creation and experimentation,\u201d he says. \u201cSilicon Valley is like Burning Man in the sense that it provides the connections, ideas and opportunities to bring new innovations to life,\u201d says young entrepreneur Jennifer Turliuk. Her burn experience this year was in part a catalyst for a visit to San Francisco. \u201cBurning Man inspires participants, invokes deep thought about what you are bringing to the playa and the world, and provides opportunities to try new ideas in a safe format,\u201d she says. Credit: Jim Urquhart, Reuters Burning Man started in SF. Its headquarters are in the downtown area and burner parties (also known as decompression parties) are held throughout the year in San Francisco. Elon Musk derided Mike Judge\u2019s Silicon Valley for not getting the real Silicon Valley because, according to Musk, Judge had never been to Burning Man. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t been, you just don\u2019t get it.\u201d said Musk. \u201cYou could take the craziest L.A. party and multiply it by a thousand, and it doesn\u2019t even get fucking close to what\u2019s in Silicon Valley.\u201d Silicon Valley certainly has a strong connection to the Burning Man culture. But there\u2019s an understanding of this culture before and after Burning Man. For those who haven\u2019t been before, the word \u201cburner\u201d has a certain connotation. To those who have, \u201cburner\u201d encapsulates a greater hope for the human race. It\u2019s much easier to see how the Burning Man principles of radical self-expression, radical self-reliance and civic responsibility are woven into the fabric and even influence startup culture in the Valley after having gone. Both places embody very similar ideas\u00a0\u2014 rapid prototyping, a disregard for the status quo and how things have been done before, and the self-reliance to change the world around you for the better. Burning Man is branching out in a similar fashion to all the \u201csilicon cities\u201d popping up all over the world as well. There\u2019s now Burning Man Africa, boasting 7,000 participants a year. On the less positive side, startups and camps are both pushing to become more famous. Camps have started to identify themselves in the last few years with laser or wood cut necklaces to signify you are a member. One of the art cars, the Christina, a yacht-looking vehicle, reportedly denied several people access to board because they weren\u2019t wearing the proper wristband.\u00a0Burning Man says it\u2019s not about brands, but in a sense it is.Well-known\u00a0musicians Skrillex and Major Lazer perform at certain sound camps and everyone knows FauxMirage as the Dr. Bronner\u2019s camp. While that\u2019s not the official name, it\u2019s great branding. Still, Silicon Valley could learn more about altruism and building for the sake of improving the world for others. We\u2019re already starting to see that with more non-profit or for-good startups like  Yerdle  or  Immunity Project . Attending Burning Man could help Silicon Valley avoid building jerktech and use the potential of human creation for the advancement of all, not just a few. Musk is right in a sense, Burning Man is Silicon Valley, or at least a microcosm of it, with the potential to influence much more of it. And if you haven\u2019t been you just don\u2019t get it.", "tags": "[]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/usa-nevada_burningman-11.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/unnamed-7.jpg?w=680&h=510 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-9-16-26-am.png?w=484&h=298 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/unnamed.jpg?w=416&h=554 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/projected-spending-base.png?w=680&h=373 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/jim-urquhart-reuters-2.jpg?w=600&h=383 https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/unnamed.png?w=337&h=598 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/unnamed-19.jpg?w=680&h=510 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-3-07-29-pm.png?w=448&h=450 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/jim-urquhart-reuters.jpg?w=680&h=391 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/usa-nevada_burningman-5.jpg?w=680&h=467", "title": "Elon Musk Is Right, Burning Man Is Silicon Valley"},

The  Misfit Developer Toolkit  lets third-party devs incorporate activity and sleep tracking abilities using Misfit\u2019s data intelligence and Shine hardware. At launch, some 30+ partners are working with Misfit\u2019s SDK, including RunKeeper, MapMyFitness, IFTTT and more. Perhaps more interesting is that Misfit is also working with corporate partners, on programs designed to improve corporate wellness. This is how it\u2019s working together with Coca-Cola, for instance, but it\u2019s also working on customer-focused health programs with corporate partners, like Walgreens, which is letting users earn Balance Rewards loyalty points for recording exercise with the Misfit Shine. Misfit\u2019s SDK is multipart, and allows third-party apps to partner with the company in one of three ways: First, they can access existing Misfit stored activity data through the cloud; second, they can connect directly to and receive activity data from Misfit hardware (including the Shine); and third, they can access just the company\u2019s proprietary algorithms and analytics software for tracking activity and sleep, and use these with raw data gathered by their own software or hardware accessories. Misfit is partnering up with a lot of companies these days, including  Pebble  (which gained access to its data early in an exclusive app partnership) and  Beddit , which is offering a Misfit-branded version of its advanced sleep tracking system. This is the next step in turning the brand into a platform and data science company, which is probably a good angle given that Google already has revealed, and Apple is about to introduce their own wearable\u00a0hardware ambitions, complete\u00a0with health-tracking capabilities.", "tags": "[\"fitness\", \"Health\", \"sdk\", \"misfit\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/brown_leatherband.jpg?w=738", "title": "Misfit Launches An SDK For Its Sleep And Activity Tracking, Including Shine Enterprise Partners"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/apple-explores-augmented-reality-navigation-for-iphones/", "content": "Apple has two new patent applications out today (via  AppleInsider ) that show it\u2019s been working on boosting the iPhone\u2019s navigation abilities with augmented reality features. The patent describes a way that the iPhone could use its camera in combination with on-device software to generate virtual maps of your surroundings, which are overlaid on a real feed, and which can do things like provide a look inside surrounding buildings. The patents describe a way to use GPS, Wi-Fi and sensor information to pinpoint a user\u2019s position and then download a 3D model of their surroundings, including points of interest. To compensate for the fact that using sensor data alone would likely result in an imperfect matching of virtual and real environment (as has been the case in other similar AR mapping apps), Apple uses live video feed from the iPhone\u2019s camera, and lets a user actively match up virtual elements with their real-world equivalents in the resulting image. Once it\u2019s locked in with a match, users can do things like virtually \u201cpeel back\u201d the outer layers of buildings to reveal their interiors. Apple already offers its \u201cFlyover\u201d feature in iOS Maps, which provides a 3D representation of satellite imagery for a more interactive cruise through city streets, but it has yet to employ AR tech. AR apps that\u00a0similar functionality to that described in these patents has been used before, by companies including Layar and other startups, but Apple\u2019s system is clearly designed to make it less rough around the edges and more of a utility than a neat tech trick. iOS Maps could use some flashy features to help it stand out, but I wouldn\u2019t expect this one to make its way out to shipping software anytime soon. Still, it\u2019s an interesting direction, and could work together nicely with Apple\u2019s indoor positioning ambitions.", "tags": "[\"iOS\", \"Maps\", \"Apple\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/flyover_hero.jpg?w=625", "title": "Apple Explores Augmented Reality Navigation For iPhones"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/seahorse-lets-you-collaborate-with-friends-to-build-lasting-photo-and-video-albums-shared-privately/", "content": "A new mobile application launching today called  Seahorse  lets you create collaborative photo and video albums with friends and family, as well as ways to filter your past photos by time, place, or those you were with. The app, a fairly robust alternative to your smartphone\u2019s\u00a0default photo gallery, lets anyone add photos or videos to a shared \u201cscene,\u201d as these collaborative albums are called. But what makes Seahorse different is how it treats those photos and videos after they\u2019re\u00a0shared. For up to a week, anyone can delete photos from a \u201cscene\u201d \u2013 no matter who added them. The concept the company is trying to get across is something called \u201cco-ownership\u201d of photos. That is, it\u2019s trying to take away the importance of who shot the photos, and give control over what becomes permanently archived to all those\u00a0who were\u00a0a part of a\u00a0shared album \u2013 the people who were likely the subjects of the photos or videos in the first place. This is Seahorse\u2019s main selling point, as its other features are a bit of a mish-mash of things we\u2019ve seen before in competing photo apps, including the default experience in Apple\u2019s (forthcoming) iOS 8 Photo app\u00a0 which offers  smart search by date, location and album name, for instance, which is similar to Seahorse\u2019s ability to filter by \u201cscene,\u201d year, or country. Meanwhile, Seahorse offers another photo \u201cdiscovery\u201d feature that\u2019s\u00a0inspired by other apps currently on the market. Called \u201cFlashback,\u201d the feature brings back photos from today\u2019s date in previous years, similar to  Timehop  or  Memoir , for instance. The app, in fact, is approaching\u00a0 the same challenge\u00a0Memoir wanted to solve , but from a different angle. It, too, wants to find a technical solution to the problem of not having access to photos your friends took, but never shared with you. But where Memoir prompts you to  ask  friends to share, Seahorse has you more traditionally creating collaborative albums that you invite others to join, which puts it also up against other collaborative photo album builders,  like Cluster , for example. Explains co-founder Oskar Hjertonsson, who comes across as a bit obsessed over people\u2019s\u00a0photo-sharing experiences in general, the goal with \u201cscenes\u201d is not to serve as a temporary space to collect photos, but a way to build albums meant to last. \u201cLots of people just have their photos sucked up to some cloud, or not even, and generally there is no organization to talk about. Myself, I would have  never \u00a0organized photos. But sharing is fun,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo if we share in Scenes  as they happen\u2026 we are effectively creating the most amazing organization ever.\u201d In addition, Seahorse offers some fun tricks, like shaking your photo for \u201crandom\u201d memories, or the ability to view your photos on a map. Its Timeline view is also handy as way to filter through a larger gallery. And it offers a decently sized feature set for any photo gallery companion, including support for original resolutions (on Wi-Fi only), a Camera Sync function, an Importer for pulling in photos from other services, like Dropbox and Facebook, the ability to copy photos between \u201cscenes\u201d and more. The service is also available online, and desktop apps are the works. But for Seahorse to really work, it has to find a way to convince users that it\u2019s a big step up from the built-in photo gallery, and that has proven a tough challenge for many startups before it. Plus, collaborative photo apps often face another obstacle, as well: the fact that among photo-takers there are those who simply care more about photo-sharing or\u00a0gaining access to others\u2019 photos, and are willing to actually do\u00a0something about it. Call it  the 1% rule , but most people are inactive lurkers, not participants. They might join a shared album and view the content (maybe), but it takes more work to get them to actually share. And finally, because it does  so much , it\u2019s a bit hard to actually quickly explain to a new user why they should switch to Seahorse. Some might like that it can import photos from all their services, while others will like the collaborative\u00a0albums, and others still will be drawn to its search and filtering functions \u2013 you\u2019re never quite sure what point will sell them. The largely bootstrapped, San Francisco-based startup is co-founded by Hjertonsson and Daniel\u00a0Undurraga, who both previously launched social marketplace Needish, and later a daily deal site for Latin America, ClanDescuento, which was acquired by Groupon. Seahorse has been in public pilot testing with 10,000 users before its \u201cofficial\u201d 1.0\u00a0debut today. These users have been uploading around 1 million photos monthly, says Hjertonsson. The app is a free download on  iTunes  and  Google Play  and comes with a limited amount of free storage you can increase by performing tasks like inviting friends. An upgrade to a Premium account with 100 GB of storage is currently $9.99/year available via an in-app purchase.", "tags": "[\"photo sharing\", \"photos\", \"social\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/10628379_695991583783673_8712969372170882692_n.png?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-04-at-12-37-15-pm.png?w=680&h=382 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tumblr_inline_nbcnx9p1vr1qg61b4.jpg?w=500&h=333 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-04-at-12-39-37-pm.png?w=255&h=442", "title": "Seahorse Lets You Collaborate With Friends To Build Lasting Photo And Video Albums, Shared Privately"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/symphony-commerce-raises-21-5m-to-build-out-its-commerce-as-a-service-toolset/", "content": "Symphony Commerce  has raised a $21.5 million Series B round of capital, led by CRV, and participated in by Bain Capital and FirstMark Capital. Previously, Symphony  raised a $12.2 million Series A round of funding . Both Bain and FirstMark took part in that prior funding event. Symphony\u00a0operates in what it calls\u00a0the \u2018commerce as a service\u2019 space. Not ecommerce specifically, but commerce in general. Symphony\u2019s goal is to provide commerce tools \u2014 fulfillment, inventory management, infrastructure, and so forth \u2014 to companies\u00a0 that are digital first, and not. Symphony is growing quickly, according to metrics that it was willing to\u00a0disclose. The company expects to see its gross merchandise volume expand something on the order of six times in the current calendar year, when\u00a0compared to 2013. Symphony told TechCrunch that it expects its 2016 gross merchandise volume sold through its tools to total\u00a0$1 billion. That figure implies that its current-year tally will be comfortably in the nine figure range. I spoke with Symphony co-founder Henry Kim about how the company intends to use the new capital. He indicated that Symphony\u00a0wants to expand its engineering team, which is hardly surprising given\u00a0the current technology climate. Symphony\u2019s digital toolset helps people who want to sell physical goods, but without managing the harder aspects of the supply chain and sales process. An old quip that I read once concerning the growth and success of Walmart fits here: Selling is easy, supply chaining is hard. The idea\u00a0is that people who are adept at building a product, and connecting with a customer base, might know\u00a0little to nothing about the finer points of running an online commerce business, or handling the storage and shipment of their goods. The company\u2019s bet is that it can provide a cleaner experience on those points, while taking revenue\u00a0only on a per-event basis. Presumably, that business model lessens customer concern regarding cost. Kim told TechCrunch that his goal is to help \u201cbrands [...] focus\u00a0on what is core to their business.\u201d Symphony wants to go beyond providing commerce tools to its users. The company has a product called Compose in beta, which\u00a0helps businesses build ecommerce storefronts using\u00a0a simple drag and drop interface. The company demoed the product for me, which felt something akin to a Squarespace-like product that could\u00a0help the non-CSS savvy quickly build a digital store, regardless of what they are selling. Compose will be released in the first quarter of 2015. Looking ahead, Symphony also has a number of APIs in development\u00a0that will allow developers to tap into its service system, without using its\u00a0full stack. Commerce as a service, then, but via an API, so you can use, for example, Symphony\u2019s fulfillment tools only, if that is what you need. The company would prefer if you used its roster of services in unison, of course. Since its pivot  from selling things , to helping other brands sell their goods, Symphony has been mostly quiet.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/email-app-acompli-arrives-on-android-adds-a-focused-inbox-that-displays-your-most-important-mail-first/", "content": "One of the  better mobile email applications to emerge in recent months  is  Acompli , an app designed for business and professional users looking for a simple, but powerful tool to manage their email, calendar, and shared files while on the go. Today, the company is bringing its app to Android users, while also launching a new feature called \u201cFocused Inbox,\u201d which is similar to Gmail\u2019s \u201cPriority Inbox\u201d functionality, in that it curates your mail in order to show you what\u2019s most important first. With the upgrade out now on the iOS version, and the debut of Android, Focused Inbox will be turned on by default. Explains Acompli CEO Javier Soltero, the goal with the new feature was to create an inbox experience that \u201cimmediately starts delivering value\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t rely on an excessive triage mechanism,\u201d which is a none-too-veiled reference to the popular mobile email app  Mailbox , now owned by Dropbox. Where Mailbox has been built primarily to help people work through their massive inboxes, Acompli instead wants to just put the email you need to see first right in front of you. A comprehensive review of how well Acompli\u2019s Focused Inbox works isn\u2019t really possible at this time because email curation and prioritization like this takes more than a few days of training before you can really tell how smart a company\u2019s algorithms can become. However, it seemed to at least not be showing any obvious mistakes when I first tried it. Unlike  Gmail\u2019s Priority Inbox  (an alternative\u00a0setting for\u00a0those who don\u2019t care for the tabbed interface), which takes into account user actions, like whether you read an email, Acompli\u00a0tries to determine whether or not you\u2019re actually responding the person in question. If you do, those emails have more weight than others, allowing it to do more than just remove the obvious pseudo-spam, like email newsletters or social updates, from the Focused view. Your full inbox is still available, of course \u2013 you just pulled down on the main screen and tap the button labeled \u201cOther\u201d to see the rest of your email. And if you don\u2019t care for the new experience, you can disable it in your settings. But when it\u2019s enabled, by default, you\u2019ll only receive push notifications for your \u201cFocused\u201d messages, and the app\u2019s icon will only display a red badge for the unread items in this part of your inbox. More importantly, perhaps, to email purists, is that none of what Acompli\u2019s doing to re-arrange your email will be reflected in your main email client itself \u2013 it\u2019s just giving you a more actionable mobile view. The addition is one of many new features Acompli has added in recent weeks, having also rolled out integrations with cloud services like Dropbox, iCloud, and OneDrive, in addition to its support of email services like Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook.com and Exchange. Though the company declines to say how many users are now on Acompli, early data shows it\u2019s a very \u201cburst-y\u201d app used for short periods of time, we\u2019re told. The average user session is just 22 seconds, but retention is high, ranging from 43% to 44%, on average. The app is also used 11 times more frequently than the average productivity app, even though users are spending but a few seconds in it \u2013 likely looking for a specific email or file, or writing a quick message or response. Focused Inbox fits in well with that established pattern of being an app where users just want to get in then get back out quickly. The updated app is being  rolled out to iOS users for free , at the same time as  Acompli  arrives on  Google Play .", "tags": "[\"App\", \"Mobile\", \"mail\", \"email\", \"acompli\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/acompli.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-3-24-21-pm.png?w=351&h=374 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/acompli_focusedinbox_iphone.jpg?w=257&h=456", "title": "Email App Acompli Arrives On Android, Adds A \u201cFocused\u201d Inbox That Displays Your Most Important Mail First"},

The settlement requires Google to contact all consumers who placed an in-app charge to inform them of the refund process for unauthorized in-app charges by children within 15 days of the order being finalized. Google must make these refunds promptly, upon request from an account holder, the FTC notes, continuing: \u201cShould Google issue less than $19 million in refunds to consumers within the 12 months after the settlement becomes final, the company must remit the balance to the Commission for use in providing additional remedies to consumers or for return to the U.S. Treasury.\u201d This case is the third related to\u00a0unlawful in-app charges made to parents in relation to their children racking up the bills.  Apple settled a separate case  with the FTC and is paying out at least $32.5 million. A separate case filed in July involves similar charges levied via  Amazon\u2019s appstore . This particular case dates back to 2011, or when Google first introduced in-app charges. \u201cFor millions of American families, smartphones and tablets have become a part of their daily lives,\u201d said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in a statement. \u201cAs more Americans embrace mobile technology, it\u2019s vital to remind companies that time-tested consumer protections still apply, including that consumers should not be charged for purchases they did not authorize.\u201d The FTC notes that the charges range from 99 cents to as high as $200.\u00a0\u201cIn many apps used by children, users are invited to accumulate virtual items that help them advance in the game, though as the FTC\u2019s complaint notes, the lines between virtual money purchases and real money purchases can be blurred,\u201d the FTC notes in its statement. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s complaint alleges that Google billed consumers for many such charges by children without obtaining account holders\u2019 authorization, leaving consumers holding the bill.\u201d The problem was compounded by Google\u2019s own systems \u2014 where charges did not require a password or any other method to authenticate a user.\u00a0\u201cChildren could incur in-app charges simply by clicking on popup boxes within the app as they used it.\u201d And when the pop-ups asking for a password did appear, it didn\u2019t contain any details about the charge. \u201cGoogle also did not inform consumers that entering the password opened up a 30-minute window in which a password was no longer required, allowing children to rack up unlimited charges during that time.\u201d It also didn\u2019t help to hear about Googlers\u2019 attitudes to the whole situation: while \u201cthousands of consumers\u201d complained,\u00a0the FTC notes, \u201cGoogle employees referred to the issue as \u201cfriendly fraud\u201d and \u201cfamily fraud\u201d in describing kids\u2019 unauthorized in-app charges as a leading source of refund requests.\u201d Google also simply referred those requesting refunds to the app developers. \u201cShould Google issue less than $19 million in refunds to consumers within the 12 months after the settlement becomes final, the company must remit the balance to the Commission for use in providing additional remedies to consumers or for return to the U.S. Treasury,\u201d says the FTC.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/apple-wearable-iphone-nfc/", "content": "Apple could be gearing up to make its so-called \u2018iWatch\u2019 a payment device powered by NFC, according to a new report from the  Wall Street Journal . But including near-field communications tech in the iWatch (and the iPhone 6, too, if the report is correct) will open the door for much more than just payments, and could make the wearable an authentication device that finally convinces the consumer market wrist-based computing is something to get excited about. WSJ says that the watch using NFC is a signal that it will factor significantly into its mobile payments play, which is rumored to be introduced at next week\u2019s event. Watchers have long pegged Apple as readying a mobile payments program, that would let them pay for goods and other things using their existing iTunes Store accounts, and now that functionality is also apparently going to come to their wearable alongside its introduction with the new iPhone next week. Other details revealed in the new report reflect earlier suggestions that the watch will have two different screen-sizes, and a curved LED display, along with a bevy of sensors to track a user\u2019s health and activity. In a separate report, the  New York Times claims  that the new iWatch will be able to track footsteps and heartrate, with much higher accuracy than the current crop of devices. It will have a flexible display panel, they say, and use wireless charging. It\u2019ll work with HealthKit and use Handoff to let it resume activities begun on iOS and OS X devices, and vice versa, and both phones and iWatch will use NFC. With multiple sources agreeing on these basic facts, the potential for Apple\u2019s wearable starts to take shape. Earlier, I\u2019d struggled with finding a good reason to justify their entrance to this market. A payments component goes some way to help it make sense, and Apple has reportedly worked with credit card companies to ensure low fees for its use, but just the inclusion of NFC and the potential for a wearable as a convenience device that offers true cross-platform communication is a bigger selling point. Imagine an iWatch that is a true companion, speaking to Mac and iOS devices as an assurance that a user is who they say it is \u2013 without the need for arduous processes like manual entry of passwords. That\u2019s a big step up in terms of providing genuine convenience. Other gadgets like the Bionym Nymi authenticator band look to provide this kind of persistent identification, but Apple could achieve much of the same thing with its own wearable, removing steps and reducing friction from processes ranging from payments, to controlling a smart home (via its new HomeKit features for iOS 8), to surfacing loyalty cards and tickets via PassBook. An iWatch with the same basic feature set as Android Wear isn\u2019t exciting, even if it does share ties with iOS devices like the iPhone. What is exciting, in terms of the potential of a wearable to finally achieve mass market adoption, is companion hardware that makes the experience of using all other computing devices, including emerging categories like connected home gadgets, easier. As it stands, most wearables introduce a degree of complication; if Apple can simplify, as it has a habit of doing, instead of asking users to learn and make a habit out of something new, it should have a winner on its hands.", "tags": "[\"wearable\", \"iPhone 6\", \"iwatch\", \"Apple\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/iwatch.jpg?w=738", "title": "Apple\u2019s NFC Payments Play Could Make Its Wearable A Computing Friction Killer"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/push-over-pull/", "content": "Snapchat Stories  are a huge hit, with the photos and videos you post to your profile now more popular than Snap messages. But they\u2019re still easy to forget about since they\u2019re pull and not push \u2014 they aren\u2019t sent to friends directly and don\u2019t generate alerts. You had to seek them out. Until now. Snapchat confirms to me it\u2019s started \u201csometimes\u201d sending push notifications that remind you that several friends have stories for you to watch. This way you don\u2019t have to nag your friends to peer into the quirky moments of your life because Snapchat will quietly do that for you. Story notifications fundamentally change the unobtrusive pull nature of Stories, which made them a refreshing alternative to its traditional direct messaging feature or injecting your posts into friends\u2019 Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter feeds. You could share a selfie or glamorous moment without having to feel like a jerk since friends had to go looking for them. The question is whether Snapchat can sustain that casual attitude while playing the secret postman, pinging your friends to drive you, and it, more Story views. Previously, Snapchat had been one of the most conservative and respectful social apps when it came to interrupting you. No shallow alerts that someone Liked your photo, viewed your profile, or retweeted your quip. It only tugged your pant leg when someone sent something straight to you. But social is a battle for eyeballs, and no one else showed such restraint. Twitter and Facebook will use any excuse to send you a push or email, with Twitter getting more brazen as of late, telling you when friends all followed someone or a few people were discussing a TV show or current event. Snapchat is well within its bounds to get a bit more aggressive. Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence I\u2019ve collected suggests early core Snapchat users might be sending fewer direct snaps lately. I\u2019m getting far fewer per day than I did a year ago, my friends report the same, and several have told me their younger family members who were formerly addicted are becoming less keen to blast out funny faces, drawings, and random windows into their life. Snapchat Stories is thriving, with over 1 billion views per day as of June in part thanks to a  burgeoning community of creators  who\u2019ve become Snapchat celebrities ( as I predicted last year ). It\u2019s also a potential  gateway to monetization \u00a0via  Our Stories , which just got their own  dedicated section  in the app. Yet they\u2019re often viewed after someone returns to the app from a direct snap notification. If those pushes dry up, Stories could get fewer incidental views. And so, Story pushes. A sign Snapchat may be shifting its priority to making Stories a strong, independent product that don\u2019t need no direct snaps to get by. Most people think of Snapchat as photos that last 10-seconds or less. But the rise of Stories could make their 24-hour self-destruct timer the new standard.", "tags": "[\"push notifications\", \"snapchat stories\", \"Snapchat\", \"Social\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/snapchat-push2.png?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/snapchat-notification.png?w=640&h=157 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/how-to-post-a-snapchat-story.png?w=287&h=522", "title": "Snapchat Pushes You To Watch Friends\u2019 Stories"},

Publicly-traded LogMeIn says it is paying $15 million in the deal for BBA, the name under which Meldium is incorporated. The price includes both a cash payment and a performance and retention-based earn out. As the name of the startup implies, Meldium effectively \u201cmelds\u201d together the sign-on process for a host of different apps, 1,500 in all at present, including popular cloud-based services like\u00a0Dropbox, Google Apps, Hubspot, WordPress, Zendesk, Salesforce, Asana, Trello, Evernote, JIRA, and Rackspace. One key to its usefulness is in how useful it is for professionals who are not of the technical persuasion. As  Colleen\u00a0wrote  when it launched last year, \u201cThe real genius of Meldium is not just in how easy it becomes for users to sign into shared apps, but also in how easy it is for an admin to disable access to those shared apps if necessary. Actually, it\u2019s remarkable how easy the whole service is to use, period. You don\u2019t have to be an IT expert to administer a Meldium account for your group \u2014 it\u2019s an intuitive, practically fool-proof process that\u2019s accessible for non-technical people.\u201d This is both a technology acquisition and talent acquisition: the Meldium team, including founders\u00a0 Anton Vaynshtok, Bradley Buda, and Boris Jabes ,\u00a0will joining\u00a0LogMeIn\u2019s San Francisco office. LogMeIn, which itself is based out of Boston, currently counts some\u00a0100,000 small-and-medium business customers, and it has been building out its portfolio of other services that help those businesses manage cloud-based data. They include join.me for remote meetings; AppGuru, a cloud app discovery and management offering; LogMeIn Central, a remote device management solution; Cubby Enterprise, an enterprise file sync and share solution; and LogMeIn Pro, the popular remote access product. But it has also come under fire for dropping other products, namely its  eponymous free service . It\u2019s not clear yet if LogMeIn intends to retain Meldium\u2019s existing service tiers, which are based on a freemium model.\u00a0Teams with fewer than five people and 10 apps or less can use it for free; those with up to 20 users and 20 apps pay\u00a0$29/month; for 100 users and 50 apps the price is $79/month; and it\u2019s $199/month for up to 250 users and unlimited apps. LogMeIn\u00a0is currently valued at  just over $1 billion . \u201cCloud apps and the bring-your-own-app trend \u2013 BYOA \u2013 have forced IT professionals to rethink how they manage identities, employee access, and data security. SSO is rapidly emerging as an effective means of addressing these security and identity management challenges, and  Meldium  has created what we believe is one of the most elegant, intuitive SSO solutions on the market today,\u201d said Michael Simon, CEO of LogMeIn. \u201cWe believe the addition of Meldium  and SSO \u2014 together with the identity and cloud app management capabilities introduced in AppGuru \u2013 will accelerate our ability to address some of today\u2019s most pressing IT challenges, while positioning us favorably to compete in the fastest growing part of the identity management market.\u201d", "tags": "[\"Y Combinator\", \"identity management\", \"logmein\", \"Enterprise\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/logmein-meldium.png?w=738", "title": "LogMeIn Buys YC-Backed Meldium For $15M To Add Single-Sign On To Its Service"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/as-box-matures-it-resists-becoming-your-parents-content-management-platform/", "content": "Box , a company that started almost a decade ago as a means of getting your files online, is maturing\u00a0into a more full-service content management platform, but  CEO Aaron Levie  says you needn\u2019t worry about\u00a0it\u00a0turning into a more traditional vendor.\u00a0He says richer\u00a0features announced yesterday at the company\u2019s  BoxWorks customer conference \u00a0have been created\u00a0in the context of the platform and customer requirements, not to mimic earlier products. When I last attended BoxWorks two years ago, I heard analysts complain about a couple of key issues from Box:\u00a0lack of metadata support and any real workflow. Box put those two criticisms to rest yesterday when it announced a new metadata service and new workflow engine built on the Box platform. And as though to emphasize\u00a0its\u00a0growing maturity, it\u00a0also announced a new vertical focus, an idea for providing a distinct set of services designed with help from third parties to give a particular industry the tools they need to use Box successfully. It\u2019s worth noting\u00a0Box\u00a0has\u00a0been talking about metadata and workflow for some time, but the details were somewhat murky up until now. In an interview yesterday with TechCrunch, Levie emphasized\u00a0the focus has\u00a0always been on the customer, not to take his company back to some \u201990s vision of content management or to match analysts\u2019 expectations\u00a0of what the company should be. He said even though\u00a0they are adding features that were part of more traditional content management products like Microsoft SharePoint and EMC Documentum, it doesn\u2019t mean the company is\u00a0moving toward that\u00a0vision of content management, quite the opposite. \u201cWe think content management is changing and the nature of content management\u00a0is moving more toward Box, than we are building something that looks like [a '90s] content management system. \u201d He said\u00a0the feature similarity could end up creating these false comparisons with\u00a0Documentum or SharePoint, but\u00a0he says Box has always been about overturning that view of enterprise software. \u201cOur platform works the way people work,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe didn\u2019t [add these features]\u00a0because Documentum [or any other content management vendor] has metadata workflow. \u00a0We did it because the way customers interact with the\u00a0content demanded metadata and workflow.\u00a0It happens to be that many of the things by name resemble things in the past, but [it's in the context of our platform],\u201d he explained. He said Box wants\u00a0to simplify these things for customers and build the tools people\u00a0need to do their work in a mobile world. It happens that they\u00a0need metadata and workflow to provide a more complete user experience in an enterprise context. Levie also rejected the notion that this is about storage as some have suggested. Storage in his view is just a piece of the content management puzzle, not the business model. Even though\u00a0Box has often gotten lumped into that category, he says it\u2019s not\u00a0its\u00a0main focus and it\u00a0took steps to ensure it was not a concern for customers. \u201cWe took this to the logical extreme when we introduced unlimited storage. \u00a0We are\u00a0giving businesses\u00a0unlimited space.\u201d As he pointed out, it\u2019s hard to make money in storage as the cost races very quickly toward zero. He added, storage has always been a means to an end for Box, not the main mission and it\u2019s not where the product value lies. It\u2019s just part of the underlying platform. \u201cWe add value by building better software\u00a0and use cases on top of that platform,\u201d Levie said. The new vertical focus takes this idea further. He said on stage yesterday companies were \u201cinnovating through the use of information.\u201d The new Box for Industries initiative announced yesterday is supposed to address the unique challenges each industry faces, rather than giving everyone the same generic set of tools. The danger in this approach is sacrificing the core platform in the name of the verticals, but Levie said in a post keynote press conference, they recognized this danger and have been working hard to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. He said the company actually studied other organizations\u00a0who had done this to avoid the pitfalls of focusing too hard on verticals, but he said\u00a0they\u00a0always try to keep their eye\u00a0on the platform. Sam Schillace, svp of engineering at Box  added\u00a0if you prioritize the platform, you can avoid the problem\u00a0of becoming too vertical-centric. He said they didn\u2019t start building a metadata model for retail or any other vertical. They built metadata into the platform and then they could tune it to retail or anything else. \u00a0The value he explained is in taking advantage of a base set of features, then reusing them across different requirements. As Box heads toward a decade in business, it may be hard to continue to see them as the plucky upstarts, but Levie insists he\u00a0wants his company to have that same mentality. \u201cWe have a start-up oriented culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you innovate.\u201d He pointed out there is no exact definition anyway. \u201cAs long as you have incumbents you are still going after, you\u2019re an upstart.\u201d As he said, \u201cMicrosoft certainly wouldn\u2019t call us an incumbent.\u201d And he\u2019s probably right.", "tags": "[\"Aaron Levie\", \"boxworks\", \"Box\", \"Enterprise\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/aaron.jpg?w=738", "title": "As Box Matures, It Resists Becoming Your Parents\u2019 Content Management Platform"},

So far, we\u2019ve generally been hearing that the event on Tuesday, September 9 will play host to the reveal of new iPhones, as well as a new  Apple wearable  (the \u2018iWatch\u2019 that\u2019s been rumored for years now, though the name and nature of the device is up in the air). But Kuo also says there will be an iPad Air 2 at the event, which would mean this is an especially action-packed affair. It could also mean Apple intends to get all of its fall product announcements out in one go this year, instead of spreading them out over two events across September and October as it has generally done in recent years. No word on what exactly it would entail, but this could imply a modest update for the company\u2019s tablet. It\u2019s also still possible that Apple would then hold a separate October event for Mac news, including new hardware and the official consumer launch of OS X Mavericks. In any case, Kuo says that there will be plenty of iWatch news next week, too, with a device that comes in both 1.4 and 1.5-inch screen sizes, and a huge 8GB of internal storage (most Android Wear devices have only 4), plus 512MB of RAM. That would make it a powerful contender, on par with the iPhone 4S on paper. The iWatch will reportedly contain a number of sensors on the back to measure vital signs, and should offer a gold color option per Kuo. It\u2019ll still likely ship in early 2015, however, with an announcement coming now to jumpstart developer interest. As for the iPhone, Kuo says that both 4.7- and 5.5-inch versions will launch next week, and that they\u2019ll gain a 128GB storage option at the top end. Again, it\u2019s worth taking the predictions of analysts with a big grain of salt, but Kuo has nailed past launches, and this is the most solid information we\u2019ve heard thus far about Apple\u2019s wearable plans, and the mention of a possible iPad unveil is also tantalizing.", "tags": "[\"iwatch\", \"ipad air\", \"Apple\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ipad-air-hand.jpg?w=738", "title": "Analyst Expects iWatch In Two Sizes, 128GB iPhone And iPad Air 2 Reveal Next Week"},

Hootsuite has to date raised  some $225 million in funding , including a  $165 million round last year \u00a0and  $35 million more this month \u00a0at an  $800 million valuation , and it has been investing that money in growth. That has also included the\u00a0 acquisition of UberVu  in January of this year to add more social\u00a0analytics to its platform. The acquisition\u00a0is a coming home of sorts for Brightkit: the company was spun out of Invoke ( originally under the name Memelabs ). Invoke is\u00a0the same company that originally created Hootsuite. The two had also been working together prior to the acquisition: Brightkit\u00a0was added to Hootsuite\u2019s app directory in 2013. The idea here for Hootsuite is to continue to add more enterprise and premium features to its platform, as a route to better monetising its\u00a0users. While Hootsuite still has a large number of customers who use its free tier, it works\u00a0with both small businesses and large enterprises \u2014 including 744 Fortune 1,000 companies, it says \u2014 and is gradually enticing more of these to pay to use the service. New customers being announced today include\u00a0Telekom Malaysia, Singapore Press Holdings, Brooklyn Public Library, Cambridge University Press, Red Carnation Hotels, and Hyland Software Inc. We are reaching out to the company to see if it can disclose what kind of revenues it\u2019s making, or how many users have swapped over to paid tiers, and will update if we learn more. Right now, Hootsuite\u00a0offers  three tiers of service : a free option, a \u201cpro\u201d option that is $9.99 per month per user, and an \u201centerprise\u201d tier priced on an individual basis. \u201cOrganizations are looking for new and exciting ways to engage their audience,\u201d says Ryan Holmes, CEO of Hootsuite, in a statement. \u201cHootsuite Campaigns extends our social marketing capabilities, allowing businesses to reach new audiences through engaging contests, sweepstakes and galleries, all managed from their Hootsuite dashboard.\u201d The service includes the ability to integrate 13 different kinds of \u201cgamified\u201d features like\u00a0social contests, sweepstakes, and galleries, and lets the campaigns be embedded in microsites, Facebook and other places.", "tags": "[\"Enterprise\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/hootsuite.png?w=738", "title": "Hootsuite Buys Brightkit For Gamefied Social Marketing Campaigns, Passes 10M Users"},

Scarosso claims it\u2019s experienced growth of over 300% in 2013 alone. And now the brand has wooed several leading figures from the fashion industry to join the Scarosso team. Robert Polet, former CEO of GUCCI Group and international model Johannes Huebl have both now joined as advisors. Founded by Moritz Offeney and Marco Reiter in 2010, Scarosso cuts out the middleman and deals directly with producers and customers, which makes its pricing far more competitive than normal high quality shoes. \u201cWe are vertically integrated and selling our products directly to our consumers via our e-commerce platform and our 6 retail stores. By cutting out the wholesale people and distributing the products directly to our consumers we can cut out the wholesale margin and deliver luxury products on half the price, compared to our competitors.

The idea of helping people find empty desks or offices spaces  isn\u2019t new , but co-founder and CEO Julien Smith was emphatic that Breather isn\u2019t an office sharing startup. I mean, the idea is basically a variant of office sharing, but as the company name implies, the focus is less on productivity and more on identifying \u201cbreathing rooms\u201d where you can find some peace and quiet. In Smith\u2019s words, they rooms should be spaces \u201cwhere you can take your shoes off.\u201d The idea, he said, emerged from his own travel, where he often found himself in different cities, trying to work at one coffee shop after another. Sure, many of those spots will do in a pinch, but if you\u2019ve found yourself crammed into a uncomfortable chair listening to the jerk next to you talk loudly on a  speaker phone, well, you know that they don\u2019t always provide an ideal experience. Smith said Breather offers \u201cthe highest level of curation,\u201d with the team visiting each potential space and rejecting the majority of them. As for how those spaces are being used, Smith said, \u201cBroadly speaking, it\u2019s a productivity space for any kind of work, not just sitting and your desk writing a post for TechCrunch, though it\u2019s good for that, too.\u201d In fact, Smith said his board of directors meets in Breather rooms. The Series A, which brings Breather\u2019s total funding to $7.5 million, was led by RRE Ventures, with participation from Vayner/RSE, Real Ventures, SOS Ventures, and others. In the funding release, RRE Principal Steve Schlafman described using the service for the first time as a \u201cflawless experience,\u201d and he said the firm was \u201csurprised to discover that not only business professionals were using Breather spaces, but also freelancers, artists, actors and general travelers looking for a quiet place.\u201d Breather is currently available in New York and Montreal, and it\u2019s launching in San Francisco. Smith said the the company currently sees thousands of active users every month, who make a reservation every five minutes. And while it\u2019s been cautious with the initial growth ( it launched in March ), Breather plans to use the new funding ready to expand more aggressively. \u201cAt the end of this round, we should own every major market in America,\u201d Smith said.", "tags": "[\"Breather\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/breather-flatiron2-1.jpg?w=640", "title": "Breather Raises $6M To Help City Dwellers Find Private \u201cBreathing Rooms\u201d"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/former-twitter-chief-scientist-launches-steven-an-emoji-based-social-app/", "content": "I can\u2019t quite put my finger on why I keep using this new app called  Steven  \u2013 yes, Steven, like a boy\u2019s name \u2013 but I do. The app itself is sort of silly \u2013 it offers you a way to log your activities and location using\u00a0emoji, optionally add photos, plus view and respond to posts from other friends, also through the use of emoji. Why?\u00a0Well\u2026why not? The app may not be as trivial as it seems at first glance, despite some similarities to  other, even goofier emoji-based social networks . By recording a user\u2019s everyday activities and location, the latter in a decidedly \u201cnon-creepy\u201d way, Steven is\u00a0gradually building up a database of information that could be put to use in the future for any number of purposes. On a personal level, that could mean a navel-gazing look back at\u00a0your past, in order to\u00a0extract certain trends. Are you getting to the gym as much as you said you would? How much of your life is spent at the office? And so on. But the app also has another element to it that\u2019s interesting \u2013 something that its creator describes as a sort of \u201cambient awareness\u201d of what you\u2019re friends are doing, even when they\u2019re not actively publicizing that\u00a0on Facebook, or explicitly checking in on other apps. Steven , for background, was\u00a0created by Summize co-founder  Abdur Chowdhury , who  sold  his company Summize to Twitter in 2008, where he became Twitter\u2019s Chief Scientist. A\u00a0few\u00a0years ago, he left and\u00a0started a new company called  Pushd , which is  backed  by a couple of million in seed funding from various angels, as well as Betaworks. The app was not first to be created by  Pushd , but it\u2019s the first the team is taking to the public. Explains Chowdhury, \u201cone of the things we missed from the early days of Twitter was the awareness of your friends and what they were really doing,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s a great news channel, you can see all the highlights from people\u2019s lives, but you really don\u2019t have those deeper conversations with your friends and family anymore.\u201d Over the past year and a half, the Pushd team, which includes ex-Summize and Twitter engineers, has been building products and killing them. The company created apps in the social space, including a check-in app, one that could track the people you were hanging out with, another to build stories on mobile that you could share to Facebook, and yet another that was about creating\u00a0content that would be shared with\u00a0friends in the future. But the app that led to Steven was a game where you collected emoji of things you did throughout the day. The game itself didn\u2019t pan out, but it inspired what then became Steven. Steven, by the way, is named after\u00a0a cat that belongs to the girlfriend of one of the developers \u2013 and yes, they were just joking around at first by calling the app Steven. Chowdhury says that the team liked it because it didn\u2019t sound like one of those \u201cinternet\u201d names. \u201cApp names\u2026are so boring. Giving it the personality of a cat, it just seemed right,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a horrible answer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he adds with a laugh. To use the app, you simply download it, launch it and let it run. Steven tracks where you are and suggests and records an emoji. If you\u2019re shopping, maybe you\u2019ll get a credit card emoji. At a coffee shop? A coffee cup is recorded. At work? A little computer may appear. At home? An emoji house. Etc. The app will learn where you work and what\u2019s home over time, and when it\u2019s not sure of a location it gently\u00a0asks via a push notification. Though you don\u2019t have to actively check-in, you can launch Steven and add a photo, plus browse through friends\u2019 photos and emoji and respond by pushing back an emoji and, optionally, a brief comment. During beta testing,\u00a0Chowdhury says that around half Steven\u2019s users were primarily using the app for \u201clife-logging\u201d purposes, while the other half was using it more socially, to take photos and give emoji feedback. Now the team is looking to see which of these use cases, if either, stick, as it\u2019s introduced to a larger crowd. I have a hard time understanding why I keep using Steven, as it\u2019s not giving me any critical\u00a0information or feedback at this point, and as a beta app my friend list has been\u00a0small. But there\u2019s just something fun about collecting the emoji and seeing your life mapped out this way. (In the Settings, you can even view an emoji calendar, \u201csubway map,\u201d or \u201cpile.\u201d) It\u2019s not really as seemingly pointless\u00a0as the other emoji social networks since you can use it for simple messaging, and tracking where you\u2019ve been and where as well as for photo-sharing. I could also see the app getting smarter over time, learning about your routines, and making predictions, recommendations or sending alerts related to that, as well as\u00a0when there are\u00a0deviations from your usual day-to-day goings about. But I could also see app fatigue kicking in at some point, especially if my network on Steven never grows beyond the usual tech early adopters. If you want to play with Steven too,  the app is a free download on iTunes .", "tags": "[\"emoji\", \"Apps\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/steven.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-04-at-9-29-48-am.png?w=680&h=382 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/abdur-chowdhury.jpeg?w=340&h=255 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_08471.png?w=640&h=476 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_0848.png?w=278&h=494", "title": "Former Twitter Chief Scientist Launches Steven, An Emoji-Based Social App"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/uber-cuts-fares-in-berlin-munich/", "content": "Days after a German court issued a  nationwide injunction  against on-demand ride-hailing service Uber, the company\u00a0has announced cuts to fares in two key\u00a0cities: Berlin and Munich. Uber\u2019s revenue split with drivers in Germany remains at 20% for itself, 80% for its \u201cpartners\u201d, as it refers to the people who power its service by turning their own cars into private taxis that Uber users can hail via the app. Uber had already vowed to continue operating in Germany despite the temporary injunction imposed by a Frankfurt court late last week. Earlier this week Uber told TechCrunch\u00a0it will appeal the injunction. Once any\u00a0appeal hearing starts the ban will be lifted until a firm legal outcome results. Evidently the company\u00a0has also decided\u00a0the best line of defense when its service is under fire is to drive additional passenger demand via fare cuts.\u00a0Uber said fares in Berlin and Munich are being cut by \u201can average of 30 per cent\u201d \u2014 and claimed\u00a0that for some users it may now be cheaper to go by Uber than to drive themselves. It\u2019s pointing users to an  online tool  where they can calculate the relative costs of running their own car\u00a0vs how many Uber Pop (its cheapest service level) trips the same budget could buy\u00a0them. Uber\u2019s\u00a0price cut could backfire if it\u00a0triggers driver anger in Germany, a market where the company\u00a0is already under sustained attack\u00a0from the taxi industry and has been ruled illegal by the\u00a0courts.\u00a0Uber fare cuts have caused driver protests in multiple markets where it operates. At times the company has even subsidized the impact of fare cuts on drivers by, for instance, continuing to pay them their\u00a0percentage of the original fare (i.e. rather than of the discounted amount). It does not appear that Uber is offering this sort of subsidy in Berlin and Munich.\u00a0A company spokesman confirmed to TechCrunch that the\u00a0revenue split in the market\u00a0remains at 20:80. Another potentially thorny knot for Uber drivers in Germany is that those continuing to offer\u00a0the service may be\u00a0risking a penalty fine of\u00a0\u20ac250,000\u00a0\u2014 owing to the nationwide injunction currently in place against the service. An\u00a0Uber spokesman claimed this is not the case, saying the injunction targets Uber the company,\u00a0rather than\u00a0its non-employee \u201cpartners\u201d, and adding\u00a0that the company\u00a0\u201cstands behind its partners\u201d.", "tags": "[\"Uber\", \"germany\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-04-at-2-12-37-pm.png?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-04-at-2-47-57-pm.png?w=642&h=778", "title": "As It Flouts Germany-Wide Ban, Uber Touts ~30% Price Cut In Berlin And Munich"},

UK menswear clothing brand  The Affair  reckons it\u2019s spotted an opportunity to\u00a0capitalize on our post-Snowden milieu, replete as it is with paranoia and mistrust about the electronic devices/surveillance tech we carry on our person, by adding a fabric Faraday cage into an Orwellian-inspired menswear line as a fashion statement. It\u2019s calling its signal shielding pocket \u2014 which is made with layers of metalized fabrics and designed to store and shield\u00a0a phone, passport and\u00a0contactless bank cards from prying eyes \u2014 an UnPocket. The company has launched a\u00a0 Kickstarter campaign \u00a0looking for \u00a325,000 in crowdfunding to bring the UnPocket and its companion menswear range to market. \u201cThese Faraday pouches have been around for years in law enforcement forensics and what we\u2019re both doing (along with plenty of other companies) is simply repurposing that tech for civilian use,\u201d says The Affair\u2019s co-founder\u00a0Zoltan Csaki. Most similar\u00a0to the UnPocket is\u00a0last year\u2019s  OFF\u00a0Pocket , a privacy accessory crowdfunded via Kickstarter by\u00a0the creator of the\u00a0spy-drone blocking\u00a0 stealth hoodie . The Affair\u2019s spin is to focus an entire fashion collection (jacket,\u00a0blazer, shirt, chinos) around a\u00a0removable UnPocket to ramp up the\u00a0Orwellian flavor. Talk about a sign of the times\u2026 The UnPocket also works as a stand alone privacy pouch, much like the OFF Pocket. So women wanting in on The Affair\u2019s\u00a0privacy chic don\u2019t have to dress in menswear\u00a0to rock the\u00a0UnPocket (unless they want to). What\u2019s the point of putting your phone/chipped passport/contactless bank cards inside a Faraday cage? The idea is to cut these items\u00a0off from any\u00a0networks so they can\u2019t be hacked into in real-time. And being as a phone\u2019s cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals are blocked the user\u2019s real-time location can\u2019t be tracked. The UnPocket shields and absorbs RF signals up to ~100 dB across the RF spectrum, according to\u00a0Csaki. Identity theft and location tracking are the primary reasons to go off-grid in this way, although it\u2019s worth underlining that shielding\u00a0only attains a fleeting real-time privacy. As soon as you pull your phone out of the UnPocket, all of your data will resume\u00a0flowing to the services you use and have opted in to (and to any governments and\u00a0hackers who are watching you anyway, without your consent). If you\u2019re concerned about how the UnPocket might\u00a0affect your\u00a0smartphone\u2019s battery life\u00a0when in use, Csaki claims battery drain is relatively minimal. There will of course be some drain if you don\u2019t also switch your phone off when using the UnPocket, caused by the\u00a0phone automatically\u00a0continuing to search for a network connection.\u00a0But\u00a0Csaki\u00a0says\u00a0over a month of testing his iPhone 5\u00a0loses between 8 to\u00a011% of its\u00a0charge over 8 hours inside the  UnPocket \u00a0vs 5 to\u00a08% lost normally over the same period outside the pocket (when\u00a0the phone is on but being unused). The UnPocket costs $29 to Kickstarter backers, while The Affair\u2019s Orwellian\u00a0shirts or chinos (which each come with a removable UnPocket) are\u00a0$98 each, while the jacket or blazer (again each with an UnPocket) are from $119. If the firm hits its Kickstarter goal it\u2019s aiming to ship kit\u00a0to backers next February. At the time of writing it\u2019s raised just over\u00a0\u00a34,500, with another 29 days left of its campaign\u00a0to run.", "tags": "[\"privacy\", \"Fashion\", \"Europe\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-04-at-2-36-50-pm.png?w=620 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-04-at-2-59-14-pm.png?w=620&h=310", "title": "UK Menswear Brand, The Affair, Wants To Make Privacy Tech A Fashion Statement"},

It will now let Square customers  link up their accounts with TaxJar , which lets companies\u00a0automatically count and report\u00a0local and state sales\u00a0taxes. While users can integrate the two services together, this is not an offer to use TaxJar for free. Businesses doing less than 1,000 transactions per month pay $9.95 monthly, with prices increasing according to volume. Square says that the service is retroactive \u2014 meaning, if you activate\u00a0it now you can set it to calculate sales tax on past transactions, not just those that are in the future. Among the services it offers:\u00a0TaxJar, which was founded by small business owners themselves and is  venture backed and based in San Diego , reports each state that requires a sales tax responsibility; reports how much tax was collected for each local jurisdiction; and tracks state filing deadlines. TaxJar\u2019s platform also enables e-filing and guidance and analysis\u00a0on what sales tax should be collected versus what was collected for compliance purposes. In the past Square has\u00a0Intuit\u2019s QuickBooks bookkeeping\u00a0software in  September 2013 , and it also links up with Xero, another accounting package. With all of these, Square integrates by selectively allowing the partner to use is API. The advantage of adding TaxJar is twofold for Square: on one hand it gives businesses another feature, and one that is usually a pain for businesses to sort out, which\u00a0may sway more of them to using Square for front-line payments. On the other, if you are an existing business, something like this could help to keep you as a customer of Square\u2019s and choose this route for transactions and other business services. The integration comes at an interesting time in other ways for Square. The company is apparently raising another large round of funding, some $200 million at a  $6 billion valuation , and you have to wonder whether it will figure in any way in upcoming news from Apple, whose iPhone and iPad\u00a0are\u00a0longtime hardware partners for Square\u2019s dongle-based payment service and related apps: some believe that the company is gearing up for a  mobile payments announcement .

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/amazon-games-studios-launches-its-first-gaming-app-on-itunes/", "content": "Amazon has just made another move that indicates the company is\u00a0taking its expansion into mobile gaming more seriously than just a way to tout how it, too, has  \u201cexclusive\u201d content to offer via\u00a0the Amazon Fire TV . For the first time, Amazon has launched a mobile gaming app on Apple\u2019s App Store. But before you get all worked up, we have to point out that the new app,  Sev Zero: Air Support,  isn\u2019t a standalone game, but rather a mobile gaming companion that previously was only available for Android-based devices, including of course, the Kindle Fire HDX tablet. A version of this app was  more recently made\u00a0available on Google Play , which was also somewhat surprising given that Amazon\u2019s foray into gaming\u00a0had before seemed only to exist in order to\u00a0help the company ship more Amazon hardware. Still, that Android app store debut was less of a commitment on Amazon\u2019s part, especially since the company regularly notes how\u00a0Android apps require very little tweaking in order to be ported over to the Kindle format (and presumably, vice versa.) The arrival of the gaming companion on iOS, meanwhile, means Amazon is considering its gaming platform, the Fire TV, as something it can\u00a0sell to a wider audience beyond the\u00a0Amazon/Android enthusiasts who have already committed to Kindle tablets and Android-based phones. It also potentially sets up Apple\u2019s App Store as a place for Amazon to sell its other \u201ccompanion\u201d games going forward, pitting its own Fire TV against the long-rumored Apple TV upgrade which  reportedly  would also\u00a0include proper game support via Bluetooth controllers and an App Store. Sev Zero, for those unfamiliar, was the  first exclusive Amazon game  for the Fire TV. Launched in April, the game is\u00a0produced by Amazon Game Studios, and is  something of a Halo knockoff . It\u2019s also the first title from Amazon Game Studios to be launched (as game companion) on the Google Play Store. Most of  Amazon Games Studios \u2018 content today is sold  only on the Amazon Appstore,  which includes\u00a0a handful of titles like the puzzle-based To-Fu Fury, a tower defense game called\u00a0Air Patriots, and an action-based title called Saber\u2019s Edge, in addition to Sev Zero. But even though Amazon currently\u00a0only has a few live titles, it\u2019s been steadily building out a team of industry vets with  serious talent . Earlier this year, for example, it was  discovered  that Amazon Game Studios had hired Portal designer Kim Swift and Far Cry 2 creative Clint Hocking, both with experience at Valve and other major studios, like LucasArts. Also on the employee roster are\u00a0those from Microsoft, EA, Activision, Zynga, SCEA, Ubisoft, Nintendo, Blizzard, Naughty Dog, Konami, Square Enix, Capcom, Bungie, Sega, Popcap Games, Apple (!!) and more. Amazon in February  also acquired\u00a0 Double Helix Games , out of Irvine, California \u2013 a city where, not coincidentally, Amazon had a presence following the launch of its social gaming arm back in 2012. (Its  first social game Living Classics , has since been retired as Amazon is now focusing more on more mobile gaming\u00a0via the titles mentioned above). As for the iOS companion app\u00a0Sev Zero: Air Support itself, there\u2019s nothing remarkable, really, to report. The tablet app lets a second player join the game on the Fire TV, but can\u2019t be played on its own. Like the Google Play and Amazon Appstore version, the iOS version shares the same feature set \u2013 a bevy of weapons, ways\u00a0to blast enemies and collect energy, and more. The app is  a free download on iTunes.\u00a0", "tags": "[\"mobile games\", \"games\", \"Amazon Game Studios\", \"Amazon\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/a1gofv1vwpl.png?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen480x480.jpeg?w=480&h=360 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen480x480-1.jpeg?w=480&h=360", "title": "Amazon Games Studios Launches Its First Gaming App On iTunes"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/paypal-expands-further-into-offline-retail-and-mobile-payments-with-new-paypal-here-sdk/", "content": "PayPal this morning is rolling out a new product designed to help its business move further into offline retail. The company is launching the\u00a0PayPal Here SDK (software development kit), which will help online merchants sell their products offline, while also allowing brick-and-mortar merchants a new entry point into the world of mobile commerce. PayPal Here , as you may recall, was  introduced a couple of years ago  as a competitor to other mobile payment solutions, like Square. The\u00a0service involves a triangle-shaped dongle that serves as a credit card reader which\u00a0plugs into merchants\u2019 smartphones, allowing them to accept payments on the fly. With the PayPal Here SDK, however, PayPal is taking a partner-based approach to gaining its footing in the offline world, instead of relying on merchants to adopt the PayPal dongle solution itself. The SDK, at launch, is being adopted by partners who already serve the merchants PayPal is after \u2013 GoDaddy and Ecwid, and soon, more. And the SDK supports integrations with \u201cindustry-scale\u201d third-party credit card readers, like those from MagTek, which means merchants can continue to use the hardware they already own. With Ecwid, which helps merchants establish online storefronts, merchants will be able to link their in-store sales with their online sales data and inventory, says PayPal. In addition to payments, Ecwid\u2019s integration with PayPal Here also leverages PayPal\u2019s \u201ccheck-in\u201d functionality at physical stores, so consumers with the PayPal app can check-in to notify an Ecwid retailer who is selling on the go or at a physical store, then pay using their PayPal Mobile wallet. The retailer is alerted that the customer is \u201cin store\u201d via their Ecwid merchant app, the company explains. Meanwhile, GoDaddy\u2019s\u00a0SVP of Business Applications,\u00a0Steven Aldrich, says that the PayPal Here SKD allows GoDaddy to integrate the payment processing and easy onboarding offered by the SDK into its own Get Paid app, which lets small businesses manage customer workflows including\u00a0proposals and estimates, invoices and receipts, ongoing reminders and thank you\u2019s, and track billable time and expenses. \u201cIt allows business owners to get paid in person and online, and to track all of their receivables in one place,\u201d says Aldrich. \u201cAlso, because our customers use Go Daddy to create their digital identities, they can present invoices branded with their own URL\u2019s and logos.\u201d This partner-based approach is key to PayPal Here\u2019s strategy going forward, and\u00a0discussions with other partners are already underway. These future partners may offer their merchants different feature sets, like those involving reservation systems or time clock management, for example. \u201cFolks know PayPal for our online business, but if you think about how we were able to grow so fast in the online channel, we really did it through a\u00a0partner-driven strategy.\u00a0Our focus is to enable better ways to pay for merchants and consumers, and we\u2019ve done that in our online business,\u201d explains\u00a0Brad Brodigan, PayPal VP/GM Retail. \u201cThe PayPal SDK is exciting for us because it\u2019s an extension of our strategy of moving our payment platforms where our buyers and sellers want to meet,\u201d he adds. The strategy of working with partners makes sense for PayPal, as that\u2019s been the way it\u2019s most comfortable doing business, and\u00a0it\u2019s also a largely different approach than competitor Square which took a more\u00a0consumer-first path initially (though that is now changing as the company is focusing more heavily on SMBs and their needs.) The PayPal Here SDK is today being made available to other interested partners for free.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/google-unveils-the-cartographer-its-indoor-mapping-backpack/", "content": "If you have been following the development of Google Maps over the years, you are probably familiar with the  Trekker , the backpack that includes a complete Street View camera setup for mapping anything from hikes into the  Grand Canyon  to walks through penguin colonies in Antarctica. Today, a new backpack is  joining  Google\u2019s mapping tools: the  Cartographer for indoor mapping . The Cartographer uses a process called \u201c simultaneous localization and mapping \u201d (SLAM), a technique that\u2019s typically used for mapping new locations and that Google is now putting to use to map anything from hotels to museums. As the backpacker walks through a building, the floor plan is automatically generated in real time, Google says. The wearer also uses a tablet to add points of interest while walking around the building (say room numbers in a hotel or the exhibits in a museum). There are already six indoor maps available on Google Maps today that were created with the help of Cartographer, Google tells me. These include the JW Marriott San Francisco, the San Jose Marriott, the Museum of Children\u2019s Arts, the  Deutsches Museum\u2019s aviation section  in Munch, the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and the Discovery Museum. According to Google, mapping the 39-story San Francisco Marriott Marquis only took a few hours. The backpack sure doesn\u2019t look as slick as the latest versions of the Trekker. Indeed, the setup looks more like a desktop computer bolted to a metal platform with a couple of sensor underneath it. Still, Google has shown  quite  a bit of  interest  in bringing better indoor maps  to market  over the last few years and the  list of available locations  has grown quickly and building owners can also  upload their own maps  now, too. With  Project Tango , Google even has a tablet on the market (for developers) that has very advanced 3D sensors that could be used for  mapping indoor environments . Google however tells me that this project is completely separate from Project Tango. Instead, the backpack features multi-echo laser scanners (judging from Google\u2019s images, the backpack features  two of these $4,500 units ) and an  inertial measurement unit .", "tags": "[\"Google\", \"indoor mapping\", \"Google Maps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_20140808_161934-motion.gif?w=399&h=540 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_4203.jpg?w=402&h=603 http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g", "title": "Google Unveils The Cartographer, Its Indoor Mapping Backpack"},

The company is bringing  Houzz -like inspiration pages to its platform that are meant to help professionals better show off their skills and allow homeowners to find the right pros for their jobs. Porch CEO and founder Matt Ehrlichman also tells me that the company now has over 200 employees and that it has hired Jason Allen as its first CTO. Allen is joining Porch from Amazon, where he was part of the company\u2019s Local team. Prior to that, he was senior director of development at Zynga and the VP of Engineering at Geeknet. To make space for all of its new hires, Porch recently moved into a larger office space in Seattle. As Ehrlichman tells me, Porch\u2019s inspiration feature is different from that of its competitors because the company can draw on its  deep pool of data  about home improvement projects. So instead of just being able to look for an interesting kitchen remodel, you can now use Porch to find only $10,000 kitchen remodels in your neighborhood or look at the million-dollar homes in your area and see what projects they have done, who did them and how much they cost (in case you either really need to keep up with the Joneses \u2014 or just get your house ready for a resale). \u201cNobody else can show you what the real price was for a given project,\u201d Ehrlichman noted, though he also stressed that all the data is anonymized and that you can never see the exact address of the home you are looking at. Porch has data about 120 million projects, Ehrlichman tells me. Many of the professionals in its network already regularly upload photos of  their projects  to the service. Sadly, Porch won\u2019t disclose the exact number of images it currently features. According to Ehrlichman, it\u2019s a \u201cvery, very large number,\u201d though. Ehrlichman tells me that Porch is in the process of ramping up its product development cycle now that its integrations with  Lowes  and  Realtor.com  are up and running.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/intercom-in-app-messenger/", "content": "When  Paul Adams left Facebook  to join customer communication startup  Intercom , he told me the goal was to help businesses becoeme more personable and intimate when communicating with customers. With the recent launch of the new version of Intercom\u2019s in-app messenger, it sounds like the company has taken a big step in that direction. The launch comes after  Intercom announced a $23 million Series B  at the beginning of this year. To be honest, when I first got the details about the new product, none of the individual features struck me as all that unusual. However, Intercom team members argued (first via email and then in a remote demo) that it\u2019s the complete product that\u2019s unique. Specifically, Adams (who\u2019s now Intercom\u2019s vice president of product) said the team focused on five key areas \u2014 the impersonal nature of customer messages, the poor targeting and timing of those messages, the lack of context, the fact that those messages aren\u2019t very conversational, and the fact that many of those tools in this market treat the web and mobile as two separate things. So for example, if a startup adds a new feature to their website, the main way they\u2019d ask customers for feedback is by sending them a generic email asking them what they think \u2014 and most of those emails will be ignored. \u201cWe don\u2019t think these five things are well-served in the market at all by anybody,\u201d Adams said. He added that the consumer apps that you probably use to message your friends are \u201cso fast, so simple, and so natural,\u201d while that\u2019s not true on the business side. To show off the new messenger, Adams demonstrated it on the Intercom site itself. Again, if Intercom added a new feature, it would want to ask users what they think. In this case, however, those users get the message within the application itself, right after they used the feature. The message would be formatted to look like a natural part of the app, and it wouldn\u2019t appear as if came from the company, but from a specific team member. The person sending the message would have data about the person they\u2019re messaging (whether they\u2019re a long-time user, for example), and they could choose the format of the message, as well as add photos, videos, and emoticons (because \u201c(grin)\u201d just doesn\u2019t have the same effect). Behind the scenes, Intercom customers will be able to see aggregated data about the kinds of responses they\u2019re getting. Over time, Adams said the messenger will start supporting more sophisticated workflows. And yes, businesses will be able to deliver these messages on both web and mobile. After testing the messenger with a limited number of businesses, Intercom made it available to all customers last week. \t\t\t", "tags": "[\"intercom\", \"Europe\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/intercom_screenshot.jpg?w=690", "title": "With Intercom\u2019s New In-App Messenger, Businesses Can Get Smarter About Talking To Customers"},

It\u2019s just another pokey Snapchat clone. As of  today\u2019s update , Slingshot\u2019s core mechanic, the requirement that friends first reply with a photo or video to unlock what you sent them, can now be turned off by the sender. That means people can just blast you their photos without forcing you to do any work, which surely reduces the friction of the app and could open it to a more mainstream audience. But the curiosity that friction created was part of what made Slingshot fun (I actually used it for a few weeks, and *gasp*, enjoyed it). \u201cSling a shot to see a shot? Not necessarily! After shooting a photo or video, now you can choose whether to sling it as a locked or unlocked shot\u201d the update trumpets with little apparent awareness of the gravity of the move.

Facebook\u2019s Creative Labs  standalone apps are supposed to be allowed to fail . They\u2019re experiments to investigate what users want. That\u2019s good, because ditching reply-to-unlock is akin to an admission of failure of the app\u2019s premise.

Microsoft isn\u2019t done making huge slabs of touch-capable screen, it turns out. The company\u2019s  Stephen Elop  announced this week that Microsoft intends to \u201cmass-produce\u201d its Perceptive Pixel (PPI) displays, which are touch-enabled and can stretch to up to 82\u00a0inches in size. ZDNet\u2019s Mary Jo Foley  reported the quote , which Microsoft confirmed to TechCrunch. Microsoft  bought Perceptive Pixel in 2012 . The purchase brought the software company the ability to build large \u2014 very large \u2014 touchscreens that suited its Windows 8 push well. However, the screens saw limited commercial uptake, so far as I have been able to tell (they did become what I can only call internal status symbols\u00a0at Microsoft \u2014 if you could get one for your office on campus, it meant something). Microsoft\u2019s intention to mass-produce the hardware means that it will sell\u00a0touch-based screens of all sizes. With its Nokia hardware purchase, Microsoft sells touchscreens that are best suited for your pocket. With Surface, touch screens that fit best inside your backpack. And with PPI displays, touch screens that can only fit on a huge slab of open wall. Elop didn\u2019t elaborate on price, but we do have some data to go on. As I  reported in early 2013 \u00a0from Microsoft\u2019s campus: And the prices [of PPI displays] are coming down. The 55 inch PPI display, according to Microsoft\u2019s Eric Rudder, the\u00a0Chief Technical Strategy Officer at the firm, will run you around $7,000 at present. In conversation on Microsoft\u2019s Redmond campus, Eric indicated that he was working to quickly lower the price of the displays. They will ride the lessening cost curve of the television set world, it would seem. This puts the 55 inch PPI but a few generations from being affordable enough for the average enthusiast. The 82 inch behemoth will likely take longer, but the question of its affordability is a when, not  if  question. So what price can we expect? Make your own guess, but we could be just a few generational cycles away from being able to afford\u00a0putting\u00a0a frakkin massive touchscreen display in our homes. I always found Windows 8 to be a far more enjoyable experience on a PPI than any other display size \u2014 almost as if the operating system were\u00a0designed for more screen real estate.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/rdio-free-station-redesign/", "content": "Streaming music startup Rdio is overhauling its look across platforms, and adding more robust personalization features powered by its own growing in-house music intelligence data-science team. The new Rdio also puts its free radio experience front and center, and the company wants users to know it\u2019s one of the only places out there to go for free, streaming cross-platform radio with over 30 million tracks that works in a variety of international markets, in comparison to the limited global footprint of services like iTunes Radio and the smaller catalog of services like Pandora. \u201cThe theme of the update is what we\u2019re calling internally \u2018Stations-first,\u2019 stations being radio stations, or that leanback listening, letting the service play a set of tracks for you,\u201d said Chris Becherer, Rdio\u2019s SVP\u00a0of Product in an interview. \u201cWhy stations? Stations are interesting to us for a couple of reasons: One, from a consumer point of view, we believe a service should let you listen to music however you want.\u201d That\u2019s not how the rest of the industry has generally offered streaming music \u2013 instead, as Becherer pointed out, it\u2019s been more of an \u2018either/or\u2019 arrangement, with some like Pandora and iTunes Radio offering up DMCA-compliant streaming radio services that more closely resemble traditional FM radio stations, and others like Spotify and the original Rdio focused more on on-demand streaming of specific artists, albums and tracks. What the goal of the redesign was to provide a more seamless way to experience either or both, depending on a user\u2019s preference, from the same single provider. As for foregrounding the stations experience, Rdio is looking to make it apparent right from the start that free users have something to gain from the service, too. All action is centered on the new Home section, which replaces the \u2018Heavy Listening\u2019 category as the default landing page, and provides a different, but not hamstringed experience to uses who aren\u2019t on an Rdio subscription, compared to those who are paying customers. Members who sign up but opt to use the free service have access to Rdio\u2019s stations, which include human-curated content, genre and artist-based options and much more, but they won\u2019t see suggestions of full albums or specific tracks to listen to on the Home page. Instead, they\u2019ll see \u201cstories\u201d (Rdio\u2019s term for its content sections in Home) that focus on things they can stream for free. Rdio still wants to convert these users to paid customers, but they\u2019ve hidden the upsell prompts in more subtle places, with the idea being that they should only arise when a user is looking to be able to do more, and not act as a barrier to enjoyment of what is available without cost. Besides the station focus, which puts stations across the navigation experience instead of concentrating them in their own section, the app also now emphasizes a new concept of Favoriting, which lets you tap a heart icon to indicate you feel a particular zest for one item or another. \u201cWhen you favorite something two things happen: First, it\u2019s added to your section in the left-hand column called Favorites, and the second thing is more interesting,\u201d Becherer explained. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to personalize the experience for you. You\u2019re going to start seeing more home stories based on stations you favorite. We\u2019re sort of borrowing concepts from our station tuner [thumbs up and down], but favoriting gives us a way to take that to the next level, and instead of tuning a station to your taste, you\u2019re tuning the entire experience of Rdio to your taste.\u201d Rdio\u2019s using this data to inform its next generation of personalization, which it\u2019s investing in heavily. In addition to working with partners like The Echo Nest, it\u2019s been building its own internal data team and is working on making its in-house algorithms a distinguishing factor of the service. The plan is still for Rdio to cut ties with Spotify-owned The Echo Nest by the end of year when its current agreement runs out, and to hopefully move a lot of that data intelligence in-house. The redesign of Rdio is first and foremost to connect users with music, no matter what their desired level of investment of the service. After even my limited testing of the new features (via iPhone beta and the new web interface) I\u2019d say they\u2019ve succeeded.

Ellis says DataStax\u00a0enterprise delivers security, search, repair expert, best practices tools, applications and monitoring tools, all of which aren\u2019t available in the free project. One thing venture capitalists look for aside from founders with a good idea is a customer base waiting for a product and Ellis says they were fortunate enough to have customers lined up for the product the week they opened. \u00a0There was pent-up demand for a commercial product and Ellis and\u00a0Pfeil took advantage by building a product that people needed.

Today the company, alongside one of its biggest co-investors, Kinnevik, announced that it would consolidate five of the fashion brands that it has established in emerging markets into a single entity that will have a combined valuation of \u20ac2.7 billion ($3.5 billion). The\u00a0companies getting consolidated have florid, fantasitcal names \u2014 they include  Dafiti  (Latin America),  Jabong  (India),  Lamoda  (Russia and CIS),  Namshi  (Middle East) and  Zalora  (South East Asia and Australia). In contrast, the new umbrella group has a distinctly more prosaic moniker: it will be called Global Fashion Group (GFG). The closing of the deal is expected to happen by the end of 2014. Rocket Internet says that \u201csubstantially all\u201d the direct and indirect shareholders in the five e-commerce companies will contribute their shares into the newly formed Luxembourg-based entity. The three largest shareholders in GFG will be Kinnevik (25.1%), Rocket (23.5%) and Access Industries (7.4%). \u201cGFG will be focused on capturing the massive growth opportunity of fashion e-commerce in emerging markets. Each of the business units will be able to build on the original Rocket platform and continue to leverage knowledge and expertise gained across 23 countries,\u201d said\u00a0Oliver Samwer, CEO of Rocket Internet, in a statement. \u201cI look forward to working with our founders in accelerating GFG\u2019s growth profile and development even further.\u201d Rocket Internet, which started its operations in its home market of Europe, has for the last several years been focusing significantly more on developing markets, which are far less saturated in terms of usage and competition, and are filled with consumers who are only just coming online, and therefore represent the opportunity for fast growth. The opportunity is big: GFG, Rocket says, will collectively cover 23 countries and 2.5 billion people, with an estimated fashion market value of \u20ac330 million. Although the names have been different, the formula has remained the same: a mix of products that are perennial, global favorites alongside pieces that are tailored (pun!) to the local market, with a matching variety of brands. GFG, Rocket says, will continue in the vein that it has up to now, with the individual brands remaining intact: \u201cGFG will maintain multiple business models including full inventory, branded shops and marketplaces tailored to the opportunities within the local markets. In addition, GFG will continue to explore the development of adjacent categories like personal care. Mobile commerce will remain a core focus for GFG through the continued development of mobile applications aimed at the growing smartphone user base in its territories,\u201d the company writes in a statement. Those five operations together have raised over \u20ac1 billion in investment to date \u2014 link through to the CrunchBase profiles on the right for the full rundown for each \u2014 with shareholders including Kinnevik, Access Industries, Summit Partners, Verlinvest, Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan and Tengelmann, but with not very much in the way of publicly released data on how well they are doing. Today we are getting some more specifics. As of June 30 2014, GFG had 4.6 million active customers and over 7,000 employees. For the first six months of 2014, GFG websites had 353 million unique visitors, received 8.4m orders and generated \u20ac436m of Gross Merchandise Volume. In 2013, GFG\u2019s IFRS revenues were \u20ac406m. It has \u20ac350 million of cash as of 30 June 2014. The Board of Directors of GFG will include Lorenzo Grabau, CEO of Kinnevik as Chairman, Oliver Samwer, CEO of Rocket as Deputy Chairman and representatives of the other largest shareholders. \u201cThe creation of GFG brings together five powerful digital brands led by a unique group of highly talented founders and managers. By operating as a single entity, Dafiti, Jabong, Lamoda, Namshi and Zalora will be even more effective in expanding their leadership positions in their respective marketplaces,\u201d said Lorenzo Grabau, CEO Kinnevik, in a statement The move follows several\u00a0other significant restructures of Rocket Internet\u2019s activities: yesterday, Zalando \u2014 which Rocket Internet spun off around a year ago,  put forth its intentions to go public in Frankfurt  by the end of this year. In August,\u00a0Rocket Internet\u00a0took an investment of  $445 million  from the Philippine telco PLDT to work on more ventures (specifically around payments and e-commerce) in emerging markets. Later in the same month, United Internet took a stake in Rocket Internet that valued the company at \u20ac4 billion ($5.3 billion). And then, long-time Rocket investor\u00a0Holtzbrinck consolidated its shareholdings across the Rocket Internet portfolio companies and  exchanged them for a 2.5% stake in Rocket Internet itself .", "tags": "[\"emerging markets\", \"oliver samwer\", \"Samwer\", \"Rocket Internet\", \"Asia\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-10-at-22-30-28.png?w=738", "title": "Rocket Internet Consolidates 5 Emerging Market Fashion Brands Into One: $3.5B GFG"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/bridj/", "content": "There are a number of startups trying to change the way passengers get around urban environments. Most notably, companies like Uber and Lyft have drastically increased the ease of hiring a car to take them where they need to go, while also lowering the cost. But there\u2019s only so much those companies can do in reducing costs due to the limited number of seats in each car. Boston-based Bridj thinks it can do better, by implementing a low-cost alternative to those options. Rather than launching another single ride-hailing service, the company is building a series of dynamically generated bus routes. To aid in that quest, Bridj has raised $4 million in funding and made a big new hire: former Chicago and DC transit head Gabe Klein. Bridj hopes to build a dynamic urban transportation system, designed to more efficiently shuttle people from their homes to work and back again. The company takes into account multiple data points related to when and where people travel to and from, creating a living, breathing logistics map for the city. With all that information, Bridj believes it can reduce the time, cost, and hassle of commuting. For the past several months, the company has been testing out that theory in Boston, where it has built up a series of pop-up minibus routes. Some routes run several times a day, while others only appear twice a day. But for the most part, routes are determined based on customer demand, daily changes in traffic, and several other factors. From a user point of view, customers sign up, identify their origin and destination points, and then Bridj tells them where to go to meet one of its minibuses. Rather than use the same static routes as your usual city bus routes, Bridj dynamically designs routes that aggregate commuter pickups where demand is highest. That leads to sub-10 minute wait times, as well as much faster commutes than its passengers are used to. According to founder and CEO Matthew George, Bridj routes can cut commute times in half, with 20-minute rides compared to city transit routes that would typically take 45 minutes. It also generally picks up customers closer to their homes or businesses. As a result, Bridj is seeing huge demand, even while in beta. George tells me that typically, 70 percent of seats on its 15-passenger specialty vehicles and many routes are typically sold out. It\u2019s looking to expand the number of vehicles it deploys and turn up more routes over time. To do that, it\u2019s raised $4 million from a number of Boston-based investors who hope to help it get off the ground in that launch market. That includes Atlas Ventures, ZipCar investor\u202fJill Preotle, NextView Ventures,\u202fSuffolk Equity, Freshtracks Capital. It\u2019s also made a huge hire in Gabe Klein, who is joining the company as COO. Klein had previously served as the head of transportation departments in both Chicago and Washington, D.C., and as such is well-versed in the issues facing commuters in urban environments. He had been recruited by former D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, where he instituted bike sharing and introduced a new circular bus system. Later Rahm Emanuel brought him to Chicago to implement other transportation changes in that city. Now he\u2019s attempting to change urban transportation as part of an early-stage startup. With Klein on board, Bridj will have some major operational smarts behind it. Perhaps more importantly, he can help the company when it inevitably faces pushback from local government and regulators in markets that it enters or expands in. Since he\u2019s aware of the issues facing city transit departments and speaks their language, he can speak their language and show how a system like Bridj\u2019s can benefit the market.", "tags": "[\"Bridj\", \"Collaborative Consumption\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/13-pax-mercedes-sprinter.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/planning-data-driven-routes.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "title": "Bridj Raises $4M, Hires Former Chicago & DC Transport Head Gabe Klein To Reinvent Your Commute"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/wacom-bamboo-duo-solo-fineline-intuos-creative-stylus-2/", "content": "Wacom has a series of new stylus devices for tablets and smartphones that it\u2019s launching today, including three new Bamboo devices and a new Intuos version, with two aimed specifically at the iPad with special Bluetooth-powered pressure sensitivity abilities. Two  entry-level Bamboo styluses  offer a better nib, with one adding an ink pen on the opposite end, and the Bamboo Stylus fineline has a special thin tip with 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity, and the  Intuos Creative Stylus 2  doubling that with 2048 levels of pressure, on par with some of Wacom\u2019s top-end artistic tablets. The new Bamboo Solo and Bamboo Duo won\u2019t break the budget, at $19.95 and $29.95 respectively, and even the Bamboo Stylus fineline is only $59.95 despite its Bluetooth connectivity and pressure sensitivity. All three are going on sale September 4, via Wacom\u2019s online store and select retail partners. The more expensive Intuos Creative Stylus 2 is just $79.95 (you couldn\u2019t get a pressure sensitive stylus for less than that when they first started becoming available) and should offer the most sensitivity on the market. It\u2019s aimed at digital artists, and could provide a better\u00a0mobile workflow for users of Wacom\u2019s Intuos and Cintiq line that\u2019s suitable for when they\u2019re on the road. It ships in October, however, so for the time being I was only able to try out the new Bamboo line. Let\u2019s start with the best: The Bamboo Stylus fineline is indeed a significant improvement on the Bamboo line, with a thin tip that works better in terms of mimicking a natural drawing and writing experience. Its pressure sensitivity also works well in Bamboo Paper at least, and it supports other apps as well via Bamboo\u2019s developer partnerships. The palm rejection is intelligent and faultless in my experience, and it has a standard microUSB charging port in the base that juices a battery good for up to 26 hours of continuous use. Wacom is also planning to roll out cloud services that will let the pen automatically share files and settings across different devices through the pen\u2019s Bluetooth connection. The fineline unlocks special tools in the free Paper app with purchase, too, and these provided more than my required share of options for light sketching, jotting down ideas and taking handwritten notes in the app. While there\u2019s still a little lag, especially with some tools like the variable width inking marker, it\u2019s come a long way from early days. Both the Bamboo Solo and the Bamboo Duo also offer nice improvements over the originals, including more ergonomic design and new tips that seem more durable, as well as providing a better feel when used with touchscreen devices. These are designed for use with any tablet, iPad or otherwise, as well as smartphones. The small but significant changes have solidified these as the best affordable styluses currently on the market if you\u2019re looking for a basic tablet pen, and the Duo\u2019s actual ballpoint nib on the end make it a great option for those who also still carry a real notebook and value the indelibility of real ink. Wacom\u2019s stylus options are worthy inheritors of its reputation as a maker of drawing and sketching accessories for the discerning computer user, and a sign that this category, while seemingly straightforward, still has room for some innovation.", "tags": "[\"bamboo\", \"stylus\", \"Wacom\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/bamboo-family.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/bamboo-solo.jpg?w=1024&h=682 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/bamboo-fineline.jpg?w=1024&h=682 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/bamboo-duo.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "title": "Wacom\u2019s New Stylus Series Offers A Digital Pen For Every Scribbler, Sketcher And Note-Taker"},

Aka\u00a0the  Lumia 830 . And \u2014  following in the footsteps  of many an Android OEM \u2014 a \u2018selfie phone\u2019, called the  Lumia 730  (along with a dual-SIM variant called the Lumia 735). On the specs front, all these devices\u00a0are mid tier handsets, so evidently Microsoft feels the need\u00a0to pad\u00a0out the middle of its portfolio to drive volume in a bid to\u00a0grow marketshare of Windows Phone. The platform continues to  fail to gain traction in the US  but has seen some signs of life in international markets, including  certain European markets . Lumia 830 The Lumia 830 looks similar to the\u00a0metal-edged  Lumia 930 , released by Nokia earlier this year, but shaves some bulk off the form factor yet\u00a0also\u00a0squeezes in a 10 megapixel version of its high end PureView lens (whereas the 930 had the smaller\u00a0Carl Zeiss lens) \u2014 albeit, not quite as high res as\u00a0the 41MP lens on July 2013\u2019s\u00a0 Lumia 1020 . Specs wise, there\u2019s a 5-inch 720p display, a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon chipset, and Microsoft\u2019s usual range of eye-popping colors on the polycarbonate rear. It will ship with\u00a0the\u00a0 Lumia Denim update . There\u2019s also a\u00a0refreshed Lumia Camera\u00a0with speedier snaps and other\u00a0imaging enhancements, including a feature that lets users snap the same photo twice: once with flash, and once without, and then select how much exposure they want the photo to have after the fact. The Lumia 830 has a price-tag of\u00a0\u20ac330, and is\u00a0due to start shipping globally this month. Redmond\u00a0has struggled for years to drive marketshare for its\u00a0Windows Phone platform, with competition at the high end smartphone price point especially fierce, given the long-time entrenched position of\u00a0Apple and Android OEM samsung. However Samsung has shown signs of slipping in recent months, thanks to price-focused competition from Android OEMs such as Xiaomi. Microsoft now looks to be closing in on\u00a0a similar strategy of\u00a0undercutting the high end competition on price \u2014 albeit this crop of devices\u00a0pads out the Windows Phone mid-tier, rather than the high end \u2014 a strategy it\u2019s able to pursue\u00a0now that it\u2019s in full charge of\u00a0Nokia\u2019s device-making division. Lumia 730 and 735 The second device (which comes in single and dual-SIM variants) coming out of Redmond\u2019s IFA presser today is being dubbed a \u2018selfie phone\u2019. We\u2019ve seen Android OEMs including  HTC  attempt to plough a similar furrow in recent times, by offering handsets that apparently make it easier to snap selfies. Microsoft\u2019s take adds a 5MP front facing lens that\u2019s wide-angle, so you can fit more folk in your selfie. The 4.7-inch 720p display handset has a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 chipset, plus 1GB of RAM and a 6.7MP rear-camera so it\u2019s sitting squarely in the mid-tier device bracket. Price wise the Lumia 730 will cost \u20ac199 and the\u00a0735 is \u20ac219. Microsoft is also leveraging its ownership of Skype by offering three months free Skype calls across all the devices announced today\u00a0\u2014 and indeed all its Lumia devices.

This Roomba-competitor offers greater suction that existing field, and has a built-in robotic eye that lets it see its environment, and map out exactly where it has been and where it hasn\u2019t for optimal cleaning. Like all Dyson vacuums, it includes the company\u2019s patented cyclone technology, and it also packs a V2 Dyson digital motor like those found in the  DC59 portable stick vacuums . The robotic eye is new to this model, however, and accounts for its automated intelligence. It presents a 360-degree live image of its surrounding to the 360 Eye\u2019s computer brain, telling it where to go next, and building a constantly updated model of the cleaning environment in tandem with infrared sensors. The robot vision work for the Dyson 360 Eye is in part a result of its ongoing partnership with Imperial College London, as well as 16 years and $47 million in R&D work for the robot vacuum alone. Dyson says it has also conducted analysis on 1.5 billion images during the device\u2019s testing, as well as running testing on tracks that analyzed the 360 Eye\u2019s suspension and tracks across 342,000 bump strips and 670 miles to test for durability. Its tank-style treads give it an advantage over the competition, Dyson says, in terms of helping it navigate small obstacles. Dyson\u2019s robot vacuum is also smart enough to find its own dock and charge when its power gets low, and can run for between 20 and 30 minutes on a full charge with no degradation in suction power over time. It weighs in at just over 5 lbs, and has an 0.4 liter bin capacity, which is slightly more than most standard bin attachments that ship with most of the current Roomba range, though on par with the top-of-the-line 880 model. Dyson 360 Eye owners will be able to control their robot via a new app for iOS and Android which handles screening even via remote connection. The vacuum is going to ship in Japan first, with an arrival date of spring 2015, and the company isn\u2019t saying anything about pricing or availability in other markets beyond that just yet. Robots are generally cool, even when they\u2019re just performing menial tasks like cleaning up my shed skin cells, but a Dyson robotic vacuum is way cooler than most. Here\u2019s hoping it lives up to the rest of the line in terms of performance as an actual vacuum, too, and that it makes its way to North America eventually.", "tags": "[\"Roomba\", \"Robot Vacuum\", \"dyson\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g", "title": "Dyson Reveals Its All-Seeing Robot Vacuum, The 360 Eye"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/publishers-push-for-ec-to-reject-almunias-google-antitrust-proposal/", "content": "The long-running saga involving a European investigation into Google over alleged antitrust violations has taken another turn: today a group of European publishers have come out urging the European Commission, which must approve the  proposals made by European Commission Vice-President Joaqu\u00edn Almunia , to  reject  them and\u00a0go back to the drawing board for more research and further proposals that would be more competitive. \u201cThis is a landmark case for the future evolution of the digital single market in Europe,\u201d said Luis Enri\u0301quez, Consejero Delegado of VOCENTO, on behalf of a consortium of Spanish newspapers. \u201cI trust that the Commission will demand that Google provides equal search and display criteria for all websites and at the same time puts an end to the misuse of publishers\u2019 content.\u201d Almunia, who is due to step down from his post at the end of October, has said that he wants to wrap up the case, which has been in play since 2008, by the end of this summer. The full response from the publishers is embedded below. \u201cEuropean press publishers are greatly concerned that the Commission still appears to be moving towards a settlement in the Google anti-trust case despite all evidence and clear warnings by European consumers and businesses that the proposed deal would clearly fail to remedy the serious competition concerns identified by the Commission,\u201d the group said in a statement today, issued to coincide with a roundtable taking place in Brussels on the subject, co-organised by\u00a0other Google opponents like\u00a0 ICOMP  (an umbrella group\u00a0that includes big organisations\u00a0like Microsoft and football\u2019s\u00a0Premier League but also smaller organisations like Hot Maps and hundreds of others). Up to now, the publishers have been sitting on the edge\u00a0of the current case against Google \u2014 which has been focused specifically on how Google, by far Europe\u2019s most dominant search engine, presents search results alongside those of special-interest, \u201cvertical\u201d search engines covering areas like travel or automotive sales, and whether Google\u2019s practices effectively make it impossible for smaller competitors to be seen by consumers. But things have decidedly changed in the last few months.  Almunia in May 2014  presented his final conclusions on the Google case, made after three  rounds  of  proposals  and  responses from Google . In the\u00a0last report, Almunia\u2019s office essentially decided that Google had offered enough concessions to make the landscape more competitive. Competitors have been  up in arms , though, claiming that Google\u2019s suggested measures do not go nearly far enough in setting up a level playing field, and they are concerned that if Almunia\u2019s proposals go through, it will be even harder to negotiate changes going forward and give Google essentially a \u201ccarte blanche\u201d to continue to develop ever more sophisticated ways of leading users directly to their services instead of others. So, to step up their opposition, they have been bringing in more complaining parties. In addition to the publishers\u2019 group, Yelp has also been  getting increasingly vocal , although it has not formally joined the list of complainants (yet). Today, it was publishers who were center stage, with representatives from several national organisations speaking up: \u201cGenuine and fair competition in the digital market are essential conditions for a thriving free and independent press sector that contributes to democratic debate all across Europe. Yet the current proposed commitments would have the reverse effect and effectively legalise Google\u2019s abusive self-preference,\u201d\u00a0President of the Federation of German Newspaper Publishers (BDZV), Helmut Heinen, said today. \u201cAs a respected competition authority, the Commission must act decisively now and reject those commitments. It is time to enforce EU competition law properly putting an end to this anti-competitive conduct that is holding back the digital market in Europe to the detriment of consumers and businesses alike.\u201d \u201cShould the European Commission approve of Google\u2019s proposals, this would result in a carte blanche to misuse a digital monopoly,\u201d said President of the German Magazine Publishers\u2019 Association (VDZ), Prof. Dr. Hubert Burda. \u201c\u2018Fair Search\u2019 with equal criteria for all websites is an essential prerequisite for the prosperous and pluralistic development of the European media and technology sector. However, the proposed commitments are the opposite of \u2018Fair Search.'\u201d The publishers\u00a0coalition that has come today is being termed \u201cinformal\u201d but it includes a number of press and publishing groups that have made official complaints already against Google and how it indexes search results. They include\u00a0Bundesverband Deutscher Zeitungsverleger (BDZV); Verband Deutscher Zeitschriftenverleger (VDZ); Asociacio\u0301n de Editores de Diarios Espan\u0303oles (AEDE); and their European Associations: European Magazine Media Association (EMMA); European Newspaper Publishers\u2019 Association (ENPA); European Publishers Council (EPC); and Online Publishers Association Europe (OPA Europe).", "tags": "[\"antitrust\", \"Europe\", \"Google\", \"Advertising Tech\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/7257629252_d506b0ffb3_b.jpg?w=738", "title": "Publishers Push For EC To Reject Almunia\u2019s Google Antitrust Proposal"},

In scenes from the series an IS press officer (yes, the\u00a0militants\u00a0have a press officer) is seen accompanying the Vice reporter,\u00a0sanctioning the reporter\u2019s access to \u00a0occupied territories, while the reporter verbally refers to being inside \u201cthe world\u2019s newest state\u201d \u2014 a phrase that apparently\u00a0normalizes the IS occupation\u00a0(although lower thirds on the video badge the location as \u2018Raqqa, Syria\u2019). Vice has rebutted this criticism, arguing its audience is sophisticated enough to understand an implicit critique of the subjects being covered. Vice CEO Shane Smith\u00a0 appeared at our Disrupt New York conference \u00a0(pictured above) back in May, where he laid\u00a0out his plan\u00a0to build an online video company that\u2019s 10 times bigger than CNN. The company self-describes as\u00a0\u201can ever-expanding nebula of immersive investigative journalism, uncomfortable sociological examination, uncouth activities, making fun of people who should know better, and award-winning documentaries\u201d.\u00a0It\u2019s targeting a youth demographic which\u00a0it believes has an appetite to consume news, just not the established\u00a0package crafted by traditional media companies. Vice Media is not the only online media company to attract big investment in recent times. BuzzFeed, an expert purveyor of news packaged as (and with) other cutesy clickbait, raised $50 million from  Andreessen Horowitz \u00a0 last month .\u00a0The thread linking these two media investments is that both Vice and BuzzFeed are taking a non-traditional approach to presenting news online, and gaining traction with a younger demographic beloved of advertisers because of it. According to the NYT, Vice intends to use the $500 million total\u00a0funding it\u2019s raised\u00a0in the past few days to beef up\u00a0technological capabilities and content production across the 36 countries where it operates, including the US. More specifically, the TCV investment will be used to fund the\u00a0creation of proprietary technologies for distributing media across the web, mobile and social, while the earlier A&E investment will fund content expansion, with Vice\u00a0set to broaden its mix of global programming\u00a0in categories including\u00a0news, culture, sports\u00a0and\u00a0fashion.", "tags": "[\"vice\", \"Fundings & Exits\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/vice-shane-smith12.jpg?w=738", "title": "Vice Media Confirms Another $250M Investment, From New Investor TCV"},

As well as helping to spread the word, Facebook\u2019s main role will be as part of the judging lineup, while the two related pitching events will be held at the company\u2019s London HQ. Despite headlines to the contrary, it\u00a0isn\u2019t putting up any of the \u201cprize\u201d money, which consists of a\u00a0 potential  equity-based investment from the associated \u2018Big App Fund\u2019\u00a0that\u00a0should see the winner and two runners up receive an investment of \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3100,000, respectively. In return, each startup will be asked to give up between 10 and 30 per cent equity, depending the app\u2019s current performance and potential, though my understanding is that this is negotiable and subject to typical due diligence. Due to the equity-crowdfunding nature of the competition\u2019s underpinning fund, it should also be noted that part of any investment \u2014 7.5 per cent \u2014 will be lost to Seedrs\u2019 standard fees, though these aren\u2019t necessarily outside the ball park for the legal and administration costs typically associated with a seed investment of this size. Perhaps as noteworthy as Facebook\u2019s PR and marketing involvement \u2014 well-timed, perhaps, considering it\u2019s currently  under scrutiny  from European regulators \u2014 is that armchair investors can get in on the action by investing in the \u2018Big App Fund\u2019  via Seedrs . Run by Worth Capital, who have done the equity-crowdfunding thing before, it\u2019s seeking to raise the \u00a3350,000 that will be invested in the \u2018The Big App 2014\u2032 winners.

HTC\u2019s new\u00a0 Desire 820  follows on from the  pair it released back at the MWC tradeshow  in February, but\u00a0sits towards the upper end of this mid-tier range.

It seems a little crazy for a current-day, consumer-facing startup to wait that long to build a real presence on mobile, particularly when you\u2019re talking about a company  as well-funded as Homejoy . Vice President of Engineering Mark Linsey acknowledged that it might seem like Homejoy is coming to this a bit late. Apparently consumers have been using the service on their smartphones already, with mobile web traffic doubling as a percentage of total traffic in the past year. As for why it took so long to release an app, Linsey said the team was focused on perfecting the cleaning experience first. (I\u2019ve written about some of  the backend technology that goes into managing Homejoy cleaners .) The company didn\u2019t provide me with a demo or advanced copy of the app. It sounds, however, like the app should be pretty familiar to Homejoy\u2019s web users \u2014 Linsey described it as \u201cdelivering Homejoy in your pocket.\u201d The challenge, he said, was making sure that experiences like entering your credit card information and scheduling a cleaning were easy on your phone. Does the move to mobile suggest that Homejoy could adopt a more on-demand model? Asked if mobile app users might be more interested in scheduling same-day cleanings, rather than waiting days or weeks, Linsey replied, \u201cI can\u2019t say anything specifically in terms of plans, but your logic makes a lot of sense. We\u2019re experimenting with how we make the experience as convenient as ever.\u201d (Another Homejoy experiment that we found out about recently \u2014  providing other home services beyond cleaning .)

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/04/location-is-everything-as-mobile-ad-startup-xad-raises-50m-led-by-ivp/", "content": "xAd , a mobile ad startup that specialises in serving media specific to a user\u2019s location, is today announcing $50 million in funding \u2014 significant not only for the\u00a0size of the round, but also for the context around\u00a0the money coming\u00a0into its coffers. xAd is already\u00a0profitable, growing fast, wasn\u2019t in the market for raising financing (it has \u201cseveral million dollars in the bank already,\u201d its CEO says), and doesn\u2019t even have any plans for what it will do with it. It seems that the main interest for now is to pad\u00a0out xAd\u2019s nest egg for what will come ahead. \u201cLocation has the potential to become the next multibillion dollar business,\u201d xAd CEO Dipanshu Sharma tells me. The idea is that location-based advertising, fuelled by the usage of smartphones and other portable, connected devices, will follow\u00a0the same trajectory that search has had in\u00a0advertising, and xAd wants to be the leader in it. Today, it already serves ads that cover 40 billion impressions per month across some 7 different ad networks, Sharma tells me. The funding round \u2014 a combination of debt and equity financing led by Institutional Venture Partners (IVP) with significant participation from existing investors Emergence Capital and Softbank Capital, as well as\u00a0Silicon Valley Bank \u2014\u00a0comes in the wake of acquisition offers and approaches from other VCs. IVP\u2019s approach stood out partly for the valuation that they attached to the offer, according to Sharma. He is not divulging\u00a0names of interested parties, or the size of his company\u2019s current valuation, except to say that it compares favorably to those of other ad-tech companies that have gone public. (However,\u00a0that\u2019s a pretty huge spread. Criteo\u2019s market capitalization, for example, is  $2.17 billion , while\u00a0Marin Software is at  $289 million .) Meanwhile, Venturewire puts the valuation at  $250 million . The mobile ad market \u2014 which was worth  nearly $20 billion in revenues  in 2013, according to the IAB \u2014 has seen a lot of activity of late, focusing not so much on building inventory but in fine tuning the mobile ad experience with more intelligently targeted ads, and ads that are more media rich. That has seen companies like  Twitter  and  Facebook , which make more money from mobile than desktop advertising,  invest in technology  to improve how they serve ads; and companies like Opera acquire companies focusing on areas like  mobile video , to help them tap into the bigger amount of ad dollars that brands are spending on mobile ad campaigns. xAd adds another twist to the mix: serving ads to users to coincide with their location. This is something that many companies have tried to tackle over the years (other names include biggies like Google but also Placecast, Skyhook Wireless, Verve, JiWire, as well as efforts from mobile carriers and public WiFi providers and many more), and indeed the opportunity for location-based ads alone is sizeable:  nearly $5 billion in 2014 , and over $15 billion by 2018 in the U.S. alone, according to BIA/Kelsey. What xAd is offering that it says makes it different and better is a technology platform that not only lets companies tailor ads to location, but then monitor the analytics behind how well those campaigns work. It\u2019s the platform aspect that interested IVP. \u201cWe get very excited about\u00a0companies using tech rather than sales teams\u00a0to grow,\u201d Dennis Phelps, a general partner at IVP who is joining xAd\u2019s board, told me. The platform aspect also lets the company scale more easily, he points out.\u00a0xAd claims to be\u00a0the first U.S.-based hyperlocal mobile advertising technology platform to expand globally. \u201cOur\u00a0business is growing very fast and doubling over last year,\u201d says Sharma. Outside of the U.S., xAd\u00a0is now live in\u00a0Germany, the UK, Canada and India and about to go live in China and France. The other interesting thing is that xAd, as a platform, powers quite a lot of other services, and so its business is not entirely dependent on how it exists as a standalone entity. When xAd first started out its approach was direct-to-market, Sharma recalls. \u201cWe started out looking at SMBs, but they are tough. They don\u2019t care if you are Foursquare\u00a0or Aol\u00a0or Facebook, they just want the [customer] lead. That\u2019s why Google\u00a0has been so effective,\u201d he says. They stayed focused on SMBs until 2012, he says, and while xAd continues to serve SMBs, in 2012 it launched a new service, offering solutions for national brands. Today they serve over 300 of these, and that\u2019s when\u00a0the revenue growth\u00a0really started to take off, he says. xAd\u00a0also offers back-end technology for location-based services to a number of third parties. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly the platform provider in this and other\u00a0situations, where advertisers\u00a0and doing programmatic buying and third parties are using our APIs,\u201d he says. As one example, when xAd came to the UK, it partnered with companies like Thomson Local that were already working with businesses to grow their mobile advertising. \u201cWe\u00a0launched in the UK with 60,000 advertisers,\u201d he says. That\u2019s, so far, without launching anything around some of more buzzy terms you\u2019ve heard associated with location-based marketing and advertising in recent times.\u00a0In other words, no plans announced yet for working with iBeacons or near-field communications. While there has been a lot of consolidation in the mobile ad space, xAd has so far stayed out of it, both on the side of being a buyer or getting bought. That\u2019s not to say that it won\u2019t at some point, though. \u201cPotential acquisition offers have been there, but nothing that we have taken seriously,\u201d says Sharma. \u201cWe have something that is special, and we are solving real problems and we want to go for it.\u201d On the other side, he acknowledges that there are a lot of companies out there that are looking to get acquired because they lack the scale for decent returns as standalone businesses, and funding is \u201cdrying out.\u201d On top of that, with the rise of ad tech, there is an argument to be made, he points out, for solutions that really are better sitting alongside other services, rather than standalone businesses (which goes back to that ever present question of whether a startup is a platform or a service). So far, though, he says xAd has yet to find a suitable property that, in his words, works out to\u00a0\u201cOne plus one equals three.\u201d \u201cA lot of companiess come to us, \u201d he says, but if xAd makes an acquisition, \u201cit will have to be more than just an incremental improvement.\u201d Prior to this most recent round, xAd had raised  $24 million  in three rounds of funding.", "tags": "[\"Emergence Capital\", \"Softbank\", \"IVP\", \"xad\", \"Advertising Tech\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/xad.png?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/goodwill_banners.png?w=274&h=300", "title": "Location Is Everything, As Mobile Ad Startup xAd Raises $50M Led By IVP"},

The new capital will be used to fund clinical evaluation of a procedure that Fractyl has developed.  Called the Revita Duodenal Mucosal Resurfacing (DMR), Fractyl says it can potentially delay the need for insulin injections in patients with type 2 diabetes.  The Waltham, Massachussets-based company also said that it now has positive clinical data to support the effectiveness of the Revita DMR procedure, which is non-invasive and works by altering the inner surface of the duodenum, or the first section of the small intestine, to change how the body absorbs sugar.  Results from a single-site study that Fractyl performed in Santiago, Chile, showed that the Revita DMR procedure resulted in a greater than two percentage-point drop in hemoglobin A1C levels, which is an important measure of blood glucose, after three months in 19 out of 30 patients. Those 19 patients maintained the same blood sugar level six months after the study was completed.  The study showed that the effectiveness of Revita DMR depends on the dose, because patients who received the procedure on a shorter segment of their duodenum did not have the same benefits as people who received larger doses. Data from the study was presented in August as the 19th World Congress of International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) meeting in Montreal, Canada. Dr. Harith Rajagopalan, the CEO and founder of Fractyl, said that the company is preparing to launch a multinational study by the end of 2014 and expects to start clinical development of Revita DMR in the U.S. during 2016.  Mithril co-founder and managing general partner Ajay Royan, who will join Fractyl\u2019s board of directors, said in a statement that \u201cwe believe Fractyl\u2019s Revita DMR procedure will be the first solution that can scale to meet the challenges of an epidemic of this magnitude, significantly improving the lives of the 400 million people suffering from type 2 diabetes worldwide.\u201d  Image by  Flickr user University of Michigan  reproduced under a  Creative Commons 2.0  license", "tags": "[\"diabetes\", \"Fundings & Exits\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/6946913471_85d9a5a6d5_z.jpg?w=640", "title": "Fractyl Labs Raises $40M Series C To Develop Diabetes Treatments"},

Broadband, as it is currently defined by the FCC, is a connection of at least 4 Mbps. That\u2019s too slow, according to Wheeler, who noted that his agency is looking to increase that metric to a minimum of 10 Mpbs. Even so, Wheeler stated that 10 Mbps \u201cdoesn\u2019t fully capture the increasing demand for better wired broadband,\u201d given that consumers increasingly use a number of devices at home that can \u201coverwhelm\u201d a connection of that speed. Americans need access to faster Internet. Wheeler calls 25 Mbps connections \u201ctable stakes\u201d in the current day. While more than 90 percent of Americans have access to at least one 4 Mbps provider, the percentage slips as the speeds in question rise: at the 25 Mbps speed, around one in five Americans lack a single provider. Less than a fourth have access to more than one provider at that speed. The implication of\u00a0the above is that if the average American wants to purchase a quick connection to the Internet, they have limited options. Limited options implies limited competition, and thus, most often, lesser service at greater prices. Internet access is not a luxury service, but a requirement to take part in the modern economy. The FCC\u2019s work to expand access to broadband is therefore a project that can look nearly complete in the vein of 4 Mbps connections, but also quite incomplete when you take into view properly quick connections. Wheeler made the competition argument explicitly, which is notable. From his prepared remarks: The simple lesson of history is that competition drives deployment and network innovation. That was true yesterday and it will be true tomorrow. Our challenge is to keep that competition alive and growing. [...] In fact, AT&T has announced plans to deploy gigabit fiber to 21 major metropolitan markets. Many of these are in same markets where Google has announced plans to lay fiber. A year ago, Cox Cable said it wouldn\u2019t be upgrading to gigabit networks because it would cost billions. Now it says it will, starting with communities where Google and CenturyLink are deploying fiber. It\u2019s as simple as that. How does Wheeler intend to encourage not only broadband penetration as previously defined, but also connections that are up to par in terms of speed? Opening up more spectrum was cited, via both the coming Incentive Auction, and by boosting the amount of spectrum that is unlicensed\u00a0more generally. Wheeler also cited community broadband as a potential catalyst for increased competition. That proposal has run into  congressional opposition , and  direct corporate attack . Wheeler, who is currently struggling to land on his feet in the net neutrality debate, is setting a somewhat combative tone when it comes to broadband penetration and speed. He even wrote out what he calls his \u201cmantra:\u201d \u201c Competition, Competition, Competition .\u201d\u00a0Not a bad choice of words. Netflix penned a  short blog post  detailing its support for what Wheeler said, calling it a \u201chard truth\u201d that there is \u201cnot enough [broadband] competition to protect consumers and businesses who rely on the Internet.\u201d Which is to say, everyone.

The screen is thought to be based on manufactured sapphire, a material that has a toughness rating above glass, but a new patent reveals how Apple might be stacking the odds in its favor with a process to make it even stronger. The patent describes a way to mimic the same kind of strengthening effects used on glass (through chemical coatings, mostly, as exemplified by Corning\u2019s Gorilla Glass), but with an alternate \u201cion implanting\u201d method that works on material like sapphire, with which the existing methods aren\u2019t necessarily going to work. The process uses a similar technique to the one Apple currently employs to color its black bezels on iPhones, which works via implanted ions put directly into the display glass itself. The ions, when implanted in the way Apple describes, could tint the glass, so using them in areas where the company wants specifically to create a different-colored area would make the most sense, and would still provide some crack resistance, in the case of incidents like a dropped phone (phones often suffer the worst cracks when they fall on their corners). As we near the launch of the next iPhone, one of the big questions on everyone\u2019s mind will be whether Apple does indeed employ sapphire in its new devices to make them extra durable.

Folks, meet the Ollie by Sphero.  Originally called the 2B, the Ollie can go about 2x faster than the Sphero, which is shaped like a ball. The Ollie has a 30-meter range, and alongside the ability to go much faster than the Sphero, users are also able to drive around the Ollie with generally more control than previous robotic generations.  This is thanks in large part to the tubular design of the Ollie as compared to the sphere of Sphero.  The Ollie is meant to do tricks, such as perform a jump or spin up onto its side. As you start to use Ollie with your smartphone, you\u2019ll go through the process of learning and completing various tricks.  Not unlike the Sphero, Ollie has LED lights built right in allowing for the Ollie to communicate with you as you play. For example, when you do a certain trick, the Ollie may change colors. When you slam on the brakes to stop, the Ollie will turn red, for instance.  However, the Ollie has some notable benefits over Sphero. For one, it\u2019s much easier to drive. Secondly, the Sphero is customizable, letting you buy special wheel covers for various types of driving (off road, race, etc) and even letting you 3D print your own customized hub caps. Of course, you can buy all kinds of jump ramps and other customization-focused accessories with the Ollie.  According to the company, the Sphero Ollie will last about an hour on a single charge.

Ease of use took priority over everything else, and while they\u2019ve achieved a huge user base in this fashion, a big criticism of the company has been on the security side. It was never secure enough for some IT pros. A series of announcements today at the  BoxWorks customer conference  should go a long way towards alleviating those concerns. First of all, they announced a new Information Rights Management feature\u00a0that allows users to control what recipients can do with a file. You can mix and match controls allowing editing or view only and restricting or allowing printing, sharing or copy/paste. If you get a document that\u2019s View Only with all restrictions on, the only thing you can do is read it -and all assigned\u00a0rights travel with the document. Users can also simply send a secure link to the document and any rights you have attached to the file travel with the link. The link can be password protected or not. What\u2019s more, Box also lets you set an expiration date on the document level, so any document or link you share can expire at a certain time. This is a huge leap for Box, although it\u2019s worth noting Huddle introduced a similar set of security features last week and this is something Syncplicity could do for some time. The IRM product is available immediately for customers on the business and enterprise plans. A\u00a0panel of CIOs speaking today after the announcement made it clear they were thrilled with having this level of control over documents. They crave\u00a0greater security, even while they clearly liked using Box inside their organizations. But that wasn\u2019t all. Box also announced a partnership with\u00a0AT&T that uses AT&T\u2019s\u00a0NetBond service to connect to the Box cloud via a virtual private network, increasing the level of security associated with using Box.\u00a0Abhi Ingle, svp for advanced solutions at\u00a0 AT&T Business Solutions \u00a0says this effectively makes Box just a node on your private network giving you all the security of the AT&T network without having a significant impact on end user experience. He added, \u201cNobody is going to take you down with a Denial of Service attack.\u201d What\u2019s more, Box now works with third-party security partners, Splunk and HP Arcsite. As Box senior vice president of global marketing at Box Whitney Bouck put it, many companies are using these products to monitor security across enterprise and they\u00a0will now include support to monitor Box. within that existing security frameworks Other new features include the ability to set retention policies on documents and expire them if need be, new reports that let administrators see what happens when internal users share internal documents with third party partners and customers who are also using Box and new eDiscovery partners, Exterro and Guidance that let companies that use those services treat Box as another document source in the eDiscovery process. In a week when cloud security was top of mind after the release of the celebrity nude photos through a cloud service, there had to be tons of questions given the timing of Box\u2019s event\u00a0even if it wasn\u2019t warranted. These tools help answer the concerns of those companies who are still worried about putting their content in the cloud by giving them a range of capabilities to control access, track documents, protect the network\u00a0and tie into the existing security and eDiscovery tools inside the organization.", "tags": "[\"Box\", \"Enterprise\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/photo-4.jpg?w=738", "title": "New Box Security Features Give Companies Far Greater Control Over Documents"},

Called  \u201cExplore Your Options,\u201d  the tool lets students submit offers of recommendation and their resume separately from their regular profiles on the site. Companies interested in recruiting students who have gotten offers from top companies like Apple and Google can look through those submissions (except for students who they gave offers to) and try to make a connection before the student\u2019s window closes on the original offer. In a phone call with Readyforce CEO\u00a0Alex Mooradian, he explained that the idea for the tool came from his discussions with students using the site. Readyforce primarily focuses on computer science and engineering students, many of whom would take one internship at a major company, get a job offer, and take it out of fear that other great opportunities might not be waiting for them if they decline. Mooradian thought that by giving students a last chance to see what\u2019s out there, small companies could get a crack at top talent and young engineers can feel more secure about the job they do end up choosing.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to start a bidding war,\u201d Mooradian says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help make better outcomes for everybody.\u201d As of today\u2019s launch, 200 students and 25 companies have signed up for the new program, though not all of the students will get to participate, as Mooradian points out that the windows provided in some job offers can last as little as a single day while others receive only verbal offers until a student confirms that they will take the job if they receive a formal offer. What\u2019s more, some companies (both small and large) have pushed back at Readyforce\u2019s idea, worried that it will push wages for entry-level engineers up further.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/twitter-bug-bounty/", "content": "Following  security breaches  that have shook confidence in many online services, Twitter today  announced  the  launch of its bug bounty program  that will pay security researchers for responsibly reporting threats through  HackerOne , a bug bounty program provider.  Twitter \u00a0will pay a minimum of $140 per threat reported on Twitter.com, ads.twitter, mobile Twitter, TweetDeck, apps.twitter, and its iOS and Android apps. Twitter actually began working with HackerOne three months ago according to its  bug timeline , but it seems the Apple celebrity photo hack has catapulted cybersecurity to a new level of mainstream interest, and Twitter wanted to show that it takes keeping its users safe quite seriously. Twitter writes \u201cTo recognize their efforts and the important role they play in keeping Twitter safe for everyone we offer a bounty for reporting certain qualifying security vulnerabilities.\u201d Already the program has recognized 44 hackers for helping Twitter close 46 bugs. Some large\u00a0companies like  Facebook  run their own bug bounty programs, but  HackerOne  offers a plug-and-play solution for companies that want the benefits of crowdsourced bug hunting without having to fiddle with adminsitering the program themselves. Others that employ HackerOne include Yahoo, Square, MailChimp, Slack and Coinbase.  HackerOne recently raised $9 million  to expand and market its programs. HackerOne was co-founder by Alex Rice, a former Facebook security team member who saw the social network\u2019s self-run bug bounty program save the company from tons of threats. For comparison , Twitter offers a higher minimum reward than the $50 Yahoo provides or the $100 from Slack, but significantly less than the $1,000 bounty from Coinbase, $250 from Square, or the  $500 Facebook provides \u00a0with its in-house program. Some are  calling on Apple  to work more closely with outside security research following the celebrity photo iCloud hacks this week. Instead, yesterday it  passed blame on to users  for not choosing more secure passwords or enabling additional protections. While it does cooperate with independent experts via  VUPEN , some believe a more open program could have identified some of the tactics used to steal access to iCloud accounts of stars like Jennifer Lawrence.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/le-revedere-groupon-shuts-down-service-in-romania/", "content": "Groupon\u2019s  international business today got a little bit smaller \u2014  92,043\u00a0square miles smaller , to be exact. The company has decided\u00a0to wind down its operation in Romania, effective today, after it\u00a0failed to find enough traction in the market. The news was sent out in an email to its merchant partners in the country signed by EMEA VP Luke Massery, which we are copying below, and we have confirmed the details with Groupon directly. \u201cAfter a thorough analysis of the Romanian market and taking into account all relevant factors, we have decided to close our business in Romania,\u201d a spokesperson noted in an emailed statement. \u201cA combination of the macroeconomic situation and the low internet penetration in the country made it difficult for\u00a0Groupon to gain desired critical mass. Shutdown of our operations in Romania is in effect from 03.09.2014.\u201d For those who have already bought Groupons, or for businesses that have offered them on the platform, they\u00a0will have them honored until the date originally agreed. Alternatively, customers will be able to get refunds for any unused Groupon deals that they have purchased. The spokesperson confirmed that there would not be further closures in other countries, calling Romania a \u201cspecial case\u201d in the region. \u201cOur EMEA business is doing well,\u201d she noted. \u201c[The] Romanian business hardly shows up in total sales, due to its small size.\u201d You might be thinking, \u201cWhy should I care that Groupon is shutting down its operations in this little, beautiful (see above) country of 20 million people known best for things like the Dracula legend?\u201d In a way, you are\u00a0right. But on the other hand, Groupon in Romania underscores the opportunities and challenges for Groupon and other e-commerce hopefuls. The Romanian operation first opened for business around\u00a0four years ago, when the Samwer brothers, who  sold Groupon clone CityDeal to Groupon in 2010 , were still running things. It had around 40 employees. Romania is on the \u201cstill developing\u201d side of the digital divide in Europe, and as with many other countries in that category, e-commerce sits as a gateway service to other tech developments.\u00a0Over the next two years, a number of other local deals sites emerged in the country, peaking to\u00a0 around 100 in 2012 , local\u00a0publication Wall Street notes. But perhaps due to\u00a0the\u00a0lack of quality, mixed with a lack of interest and infrastructure, that number declined steeply in more recent times. Groupon was among those who may have been one of the bigger deal companies in the Romanian market, but that didn\u2019t always translate into profit. In 2013, the\u00a0company reported a loss in the country of \u20ac540,000 ($709,000). That was down from a loss of \u20ac773,000 ($1 million) in 2012, but apparently with declining customers. The\u00a0wider context for Groupon in Europe is that the company has had some  challenging years  in the region after its\u00a0CityDeal acquisition, with a lack of operational, technical (and maybe cultural) integration between what was happening in the U.S. and in Europe. That is one\u00a0of the reasons why Groupon so often launches new services in the U.S. that cannot be rolled out concurrently elsewhere (one example: the  timed reservations feature  that Groupon launched today). This is now changing, though. Although Groupon  in the last quarter  reported\u00a0flat gross billings in the EMEA region compared to a year ago, revenues\u00a0have been a more encouraging story, with EMEA seeing the highest revenue growth of the three regions: Still, the company\u2019s last earnings report  disappointed  investors with the company failing to meet analyst estimates. With North America continuing to be Groupon\u2019s growth engine, it\u2019s\u00a0not a surprise to see the company\u00a0cleaning house and looking to firm up underperforming operations elsewhere. Whether that strategy will manifest in other ways is still to be seen.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/the-ice-bucket-challenge-by-the-numbers/", "content": "The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has shown that other things besides\u00a0 Grumpy Cats  and  silly dance videos \u00a0can go viral \u2013 even charitable giving. And while some questioned if having people dumping buckets of ice on their heads was the best way to raise money for the\u00a0non-profit organization fighting Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, it turns out those concerns were unfounded: ALSA.org reports that as of September 2, it has received $106 million in Ice Bucket donations from over 3 million donors. Donations have ranged from under $1 to $200,000, the organization reports, and have come from individuals, corporations and other foundations. Individuals who donated between $100,000 and $200,000 have included actors Leonardo DiCaprio and David Spade, T-Mobile CEO John Legere and Chairman of Carnival Cruise Lines Micky Arison. The spotlight has brought a heightened awareness about\u00a0the disease and related research efforts, but it has also put ALSA under attack to some extent, forcing it to defend itself against  claims\u00a0from satire websites  that people share on social media as if they\u2019re hard news.  (This is why  Facebook has been testing\u00a0the use of a \u201csatire\u201d tag \u00a0on shared news stories \u2013 Facebook users apparently have difficulty discerning truth from bias and falsehoods.) While the challenge\u2019s success as a viral meme should be the feel-good story of a year filled with bad news involving\u00a0wars and violence and terrorism, some in the media have poured cold water (ha!) on the positive, warm-and-fuzzy feelings this viral act of charity has\u00a0inspired.  Quartz pointed out , for example, that the ALSA is sucking in donations at the expense of other charities, who will now suffer.  Vice said  the challenge is \u201cnarcissism masked as altruism,\u201d which  BBC countered \u00a0by saying that might\u00a0not be such a bad thing. The Ice Bucket Challenge has proven to be an interesting study into the spread of viral memes, as well. Earlier in August,\u00a0 Facebook\u2019s data scientists looked at data  from June 1 through August 17,\u00a0and visualized the challenge\u2019s spread across the U.S. The spread structure was centered in Boston, which Facebook speculates could be attributed to\u00a0former Boston College baseball player,  Pete Frates , who was diagnosed with ALS in 2012. This is a notable data point, since the challenge\u2019s origins are actually somewhat unclear, and have been attributed to a number of sources, including a \u201ccold water challenge\u201d that began in the Northern U.S., which is documented in more detail on  KnowYourMeme.com . The original version involved jumping into cold water, then nominating another to do the same. Later, this became the ice bucket dump, and charitable donations were the result of refusing to participate. By late July 2014, however, the charity being named was the ALS Foundation. The challenge spread worldwide on Facebook to the following countries (in order of participation): Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Philippines, Puerto Rico and India. During that time frame, over 28 million people joined the challenge by posting, commenting or liking a challenge post, Facebook said. Meanwhile, Facebook\u2019s video platform was heavily utilized for sharing the actual ice bucket challenge videos. Facebook says 2.4 million videos were shared on the network during those dates. Celebrities, singers and musicians, sports figures, TV shows\u2019 cast and crews, CEOs and other business leaders, have since participated, allowing the ALS Challenge to spread even further. We\u2019ve covered some of these videos here at TechCrunch, as related to tech executives, including challenge videos from  Bill Gates, Tim Cook ,  Apple SVP Phil Schiller ,  Mark Zuckerberg ,  Sheryl Sandberg ,  Satya Nadella ,  Larry Page and Sergey Brin ,  Jeff Bezos ,  Philip Kaplan (@pud), Ev Williams, Kevin Rose, and Bryan Mason , and  more . According to  data curated  by media analyst Jeremiah Owyang, near the end of August, the challenge had then been responsible for around 2,330,000 YouTube videos and was responsible for more Google searches than Gaza, Ferguson, and Iraq combined. (See below slideshow). That latter statistic may seem depressing, but the fact that the Challenge emerged amid an\u00a0otherwise horrific news cycle could have  actually helped contribute to its success . People needed a bright spot to cling to. Data from video analytics company  Strike Social  shared at the end of August, notes that Charlie Sheen\u2019s Ice Bucket Challenge video had by then just narrowly beaten out Bill Gates\u2019 video in terms of views, with 16,743,369 views on the TMZ YouTube channel versus 16,031,256 views on Gates\u2019 thegatesnotes channel. Others near the top of the list included Cristiano Ronaldo, the \u201cfails\u201d compilation (people whose challenge videos went horribly wrong), Kermit the Frog\u2019s challenge video, and those from other celebs. Web analytics firm  SimilarWeb  also looked into the top five celebrity videos on YouTube, ranked in order of their search engine popularity for driving traffic to YouTube and found that Charlie Sheen again beat out Bill Gates on this metric as well, followed by Chris Pratt, Lady Gaga, and Kate Upton. Of course, the video numbers are ever-changing as new viewers stumble across the challenge videos and Facebook posts every day. While much of the data about the challenge so far has focused on the number of videos and increasing size of the donations,  SimilarWeb  also took a look at how the viral sensation also affected the ALSA.org website itself, along with other organizations. The company tracked data from over 30 million websites with 1.1 trillion visits for the months of July and August 2014, to arrive at its conclusions. Before the Ice Bucket Challenge, the website was averaging close to 8,000 visitors per day. Over the last 4 weeks, that changed dramatically, with the average number of visitors rising to 630,000 per day, or an increase of 7,775%. During the month of July, 11% of visitors clicked on the donate button to go make donations, and by August 24th, the organization  shared  that it had already raised $70.2 million from 1.3 million donations, compared with $2.5 million raised during the same time (July 29-Aug. 24) the year before. This data tracks against the 10.3 million visitors to the ALSA.org\u00a0website during the period SimilarWeb measured, resulting in 10% of web visits converting into real money donations, the firm reports. Additionally, news sites covering the challenge have benefitted too, SimilarWeb notes, with ALS as the #7 trending news keyword referring traffic to CBS News, for example, and the #4 top traffic keyword referring traffic to Forbes.com, which is averaging over 200,000 visits per week on ALS and Ice Bucket Challenge search terms. The Challenge even impacted Wikipedia, resulting in a more than 100 times rise in pageviews for ALS, which speaks to its capacity for awareness-raising. Did the  #IceBucketChallenge  impact public awareness? YES More than 100x rise in Wikipedia pageviews for ALS:  http://t.co/ScsjqMiBSB \u2014 Jimmy Wales (@jimmy_wales)  August 28, 2014 The challenge has not been without its critics, of course. In addition to the above-mentioned claims of how it could hurt other charities, or how it contributes to a generation\u2019s self-indulgence, others have said the challenge is an example of \u201cslacktivism,\u201d  meaning  a sort of stunt philanthropic gesture that  won\u2019t lead to an ongoing relationship between the\u00a0charity and donor . That may be true, but with over $100 million raised thanks to the challenge, the ALSA\u00a0should be doing okay for at least a little while. And when they use these funds up, maybe the world will be ready for Ice Bucket, take 2. At the end of the day, the Ice Bucket Challenge was successful because it took a simple formula for viral content creation, and added the charitable request as part of its easily\u00a0reproducible format. TechCrunch examined this \u201csymbiotic meme\u201d structure before , following the Harlem Shake\u2019s rise as a\u00a0viral sensation. The idea, simply put, is to create a short video where users can insert their own variables into the equation, and replicate the action with little video production skill. Pouring an ice bucket over one\u2019s head \u2013 or having a friend do it \u2013 is easy to mimic. The Ice Bucket Challenge\u2019s legacy is that it could become a blueprint\u00a0for achieving viral success, which  other charities could choose to replicate . Simply ask the selfie generation to once again turn their cameras on themselves, but infuse that act with a higher purpose.", "tags": "[\"viral\", \"Meme\", \"ice bucket challenge\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/gates-bucket.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/o-mark-zuckerberg-ice-bucket-facebook.jpg?w=680&h=340 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/theicebucketchallenge_usa.png?w=680&h=340 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/theicebucketchallenge_ne.png?w=565&h=680 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/tim-cook-ice-bucket-challenge.jpg?w=600&h=337 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-11-08-50-am.png?w=680&h=370", "title": "The Ice Bucket Challenge, By The Numbers "},

The company also indicated that it is working to extend its integration into Office 365\u2019s online tools, and, if possible, to\u00a0Office for iPad. On stage at the conference, Box CEO Aaron Levie asked the audience to tweet at current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Twitter \u2014 it\u2019s  @SatyaNadella , if you were curious \u2014 for his assistance\u00a0in allowing Box to integrate with Office for the iPad. Microsoft, which has a customer base that reaches\u00a0into the enterprise market, may not be too receptive to the pitch. Microsoft sells OneDrive for Business, Sharepoint, and other storage and collaboration tools that Box competes with. That fact may make its willingness to help Box somewhat limited. Levie directly cited customer demand as the reason for his proposed integration into Office for iPad. That\u2019s notable\u00a0as it indicates that there is large enterprise uptake of the Microsoft productivity suite inside of corporations. Box\u2019s CEO  previously told TechCrunch  that Office 365 has done \u201cincredibly well,\u201d\u00a0so to see the smaller company integrate with the service\u00a0is not surprising. Box\u2019s customers, which skew heavily towards the business space, are likely Office users, and thus are potential Office 365 users. The overlap is considerable. Following its Office 365 integration beta kickoff announcement, Box pivoted to discussing its BoxNotes product, which competes with Office. The company shared a few vanity metrics about the service, but no hard user figures. BoxNotes competes with Office in that it allows for the creation, and editing of text files. Integration, and competition, are therefore the tones of the day.", "tags": "[\"boxworks\", \"Box\", \"Enterprise\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-9-17-32-am.png?w=738", "title": "Box Pushes Its Office 365 Integration Into Beta"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/intel-debuts-the-mica-a-fashionable-smart-bracelet-designed-by-opening-ceremonies/", "content": "Intel is  super excited  about the idea of making computers that don\u2019t look like computers, namely in the wearables space. Instead of latching a mini smartphone screen onto a wrist band, the technology company wants to be the brains behind the operation, not the looks. That said, Intel has partnered with Opening Ceremonies to bring a new female-oriented wearable to the market.  They haven\u2019t been super forth coming about the software or its capabilities/features, but we do know a bit about the hardware. For one, it will be called MICA (my intelligent communications accessory) and it will debut at the Opening Ceremonies runway show at New York Fashion Week.  Unlike most of the wearables on the market, it looks more like a bracelet than a smart watch, built with premium materials like semi-precious gems, snakeskin, pearls, tiger\u2019s eye and obsidian. The Mica will feature a 1.6-inch curved Sapphire touchscreen OLED display. It has a 256 x 160 resolution. That said, the touchscreen will be worn on the inside of the wrist as opposed to on the outside like a smart watch, letting the fashion-centric part of the design shine.  The company is calling it a notifications device, hinting that it will probably keep users in the know with their social media updates, calendar reminders, text messages, and other inbound content. We\u2019ve also learned that it will have its own 3G radio, offering connectivity without having to pair the bracelet to a smartphone.  The bracelet has a clasp near the touchscreen to get it on and off, an dcomes with wireless charging or the option to charge via USB.  Intel worked with both Opening Ceremonies and the CFDA to ensure that this wearable focuses on fashion and not necessarily tech specs. We\u2019ve seen this approach before from smaller startups, like  Memi , but this is the first time that a major tech player has genuinely approached design this way.  That said, the MICA will probably cost $300 at the very least, as Intel and Opening Ceremonies expect it to retail at around the same price as other jewelry in Opening Ceremonies portofolio.  It will be available before the holidays at both Opening Ceremonies and Barney\u2019s.

Leto has been in the music and movie industry for a long time and as he pointed out, back in the day, he couldn\u2019t communicate directly with his audience. There was no Twitter. He needed to get a record company to pay attention to him, to sign him, record him and distribute the product. Today, he pointed out he doesn\u2019t really sell music directly. People generally just take it and he encourages that. He joked he says at concerts, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you steal my music but go to a store and do it. Be brave.\u201d He said he makes his money through relentless touring and his band, 30 Seconds to Mars has been on the road for so long, it actually earned  The Guinness Book of World Records for the longest continuously touring band \u00a0in a single album cycle. He says you can sit and cry about the changing world, but you have to recognize it and take advantage of it, and he and his band have found a way to do that. His point though wasn\u2019t that people were stealing per se, but they were interacting with his music and that\u2019s all any artist can ask. As he said, the internet opens up a conversation with the audience and it gives artists the opportunity to find an audience. It doesn\u2019t guarantee success, but it\u2019s an opportunity that just didn\u2019t exist before the internet and social media. \u201cTechnology is the great equalizer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s shifted balance of power from gatekeepers, not just to artists, but to audiences too,\u201d Leto explained. And Leto isn\u2019t just a musician, he has several digital businesses he\u2019s launched as separate projects. He joked his first business was selling pot as a kid, but his businesses today take advantage of the internet (and they\u2019re legal). One is called  Adventures in Wonderland , which hosts VIP packages and offers another way for artists and fans to interact. Artists can do meet and greets after the show and fans can get good seats or can stand by the side of the stage and watch the band. He said what was the core value of a musician has changed. It used to be the album or CD, but as it moves to touring, having that relationship with fans becomes ever more crucial. \u00a0", "tags": "[\"Jared Leto\", \"Aaron Levie\", \"boxworks\", \"Box\", \"Enterprise\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/photo-2.jpg?w=738", "title": "Jared Leto Is Surprise Guest At BoxWorks, Talks Digital Transformation"},

Isaacson is probably best-known to TechCrunch readers as the author of the bestselling biography  Steve Jobs , but he also wrote acclaimed volumes on Henry Kissinger, Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein. And he serves as president and CEO of the Aspen Institute. Isaacson has a new book coming out in October, titled  The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution . The book covers innovators from Ada Lovelace to Larry Page, and in the words of its publisher, \u201cis destined to be the standard history of the digital revolution and an indispensable guide to how innovation really happens.\u201d Prior to publication, Isaacson took an interesting approach to getting crowdsourced feedback and fact-checking \u2014 he posted excerpts online, asking for comments and corrections. ( And he got them .) Specifically, he published those excerpts on blogging platform Medium, where Williams is\u00a0CEO. Williams is a pretty notable innovator himself. He co-founded Blogger and Twitter, and at  Medium , he\u2019s building  a new kind of media company  that combines a\u00a0publishing platform with high-quality, journalistic content.

To open your door, you simply disengage the floor attachment and open it normally. There are no locks to pick or deadbolts to crack, simply because you don\u2019t need to use those to keep the door closed. Created by Alex Bertelli, former Army man turned business development expert in Tennessee, and serial entrepreneur Clay Banks, the product uses your phone or a specially keyed fob to open and close the door at will. \u201cWe built this because we knew there had to be a better way to use technology to protect our families and we didn\u2019t want to be a victim of the next break-in,\u201d said Banks.

This tool will allow budding children\u2019s book authors to create chapter books and illustrated children\u2019s books that are able to take advantage of Kindle features like text pop-ups, explains Amazon in an  announcement  about the new services. After the book is finalized, authors can also use the tool to upload the book to KDP while also stipulating the category, age and grade range filters needed to get\u00a0the book listed correctly. Optionally, KDP Kids authors can also enroll in KDP Select which allows them to earn royalties through Kindle Unlimited and the\u00a0Kindle Owners\u2019 Lending Library. They would then also have the ability use other marketing tools available to Select authors, like the\u00a0Kindle Countdown Deals and Free Book Promotions. The  book creator tool  doesn\u2019t just have to be for new authors looking for a way onto Amazon\u2019s Kindle platform, however, but could also support established authors looking to convert their books into a Kindle format in order to expand their reader base. The software is available as both a Mac and PC download, and lets chapter book authors import manuscripts in Word (doc/docx), as well as HTML, Mobi, ePub and other formats, so there isn\u2019t much need for additional conversion tools. Meanwhile, illustrated book authors can import files in PDF, PNG, JPG, TIFF, and PPM formats. \u201cKids\u201d is now\u00a0one of many genres KDP supports today, which also includes categories like Literature, Business, Mystery/Thriller, Non-Fiction, Romance, Sci-Fi, Teens/Young Adult and more. But children\u2019s books are\u00a0a potentially growing category for Amazon, as the youngest generation of readers today will be using tablet devices even before their first birthday in many cases, and will be comfortable moving to a digital reading format having never remembered the era where hardbound and paperback books were your only choices for reading. The announcement comes at a time when Amazon is embroiled in a  battle with publisher Hachette,  which has put authors \u2013 and their readers \u2013\u00a0in the middle. But it also comes at a time when indie publishing is on the rise, having produced break-out hits (of questionable literary quality) like  50 Shades of Gray.\u00a0 It makes sense that Amazon would want to tap into this growing trend for other genres, too \u2013 especially as it markets its own Kindle Fire tablets to\u00a0families with small\u00a0children, where\u00a0features like Kindle Free Time enable safe use of the device\u00a0among ever-younger users, while\u00a0other parental controls\u00a0 encourage and rewarding on-device reading .", "tags": "[\"kdp\", \"kids\", \"books\", \"Amazon\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/kids_page_hero-_cb345447331_.jpg?w=738", "title": "Amazon Invites Children\u2019s Book Authors To Kindle Direct Publishing, Rolls Out Kids\u2019 Book Creator Software"},

While it is not exactly clear how your privacy was violated and your property was stolen, there is apparently an  underground ring of people  who spend their precious lives perpetuating these kinds of actions \u2014 \u201ccollecting\u201d stolen, private images of both famous and non-famous women to gawk at in online backchannels. Though I was aware through my job that this subsection of the Internet existed, I had no idea it was this orchestrated, at this scale. Quite frankly, this fact is terrifying. Everyone has things on their phones they don\u2019t want other people to see. Everyone. It sucks to be a woman on the Internet when there  isn\u2019t  some sort of bounty program for your private information. All day you are sized up and objectified and abstracted. Just read  the comments . We are quite literally made inhuman online. And we are dehumanized even further by whatever the hell is going on in  Anon-ib  and beyond. At its essence, this is a crime against all women, which is a crime against humanity, and  no number of charitable donations  can ever make amends for it. If someone gives you generalized \u201cadvice\u201d on what you could have done to avoid this, give them the bird. I\u2019m sure you know by now how to pick a more difficult password and random answers to your security questions. If  the theories  are accurate, what went down is a bit more complicated than that, involving many different individuals and points of failure. When the  news first broke , I was angry that Apple makes people wait three days to enable two-factor authentication on their iCloud accounts. It turns out  two-factor authentication may have not entirely protected anyone  in this case. The criminals apparently\u00a0 used ElcomSoft ,\u00a0 a law enforcement tool(!), to expedite the extraction of information from iCloud backups, not protected by two-factor. \u201cMy iCloud keeps telling me to back it up and I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to back you up. Do it yourself,\u201d you  joked  once. I have had the exact same thought at that exact same notification, because iCloud can be quite complicated: If you have Photo Stream toggled on (the default), it automatically sends your photos to iCloud, where they exist even if you delete them from\u00a0your phone. There\u2019s a reason that a ( technically inaccurate) movie  was made about this process. The concept of automatic photo and video uploads is more fraught with issues than it seems at first, and there\u2019s no automatic way to see what\u2019s up there when it\u2019s up there. If I and other industry reporters  like Mat Honan  don\u2019t know how exactly to absolutely protect ourselves, because the targets and tools are always changing, how will people who don\u2019t have our exposure to tech? The onus is on Apple and other tech platforms like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft to keep their customers \u2014 us \u2014 safe. Though stolen photos are being shared that have been extracted from Android and Windows Phone backups, too, I\u2019m singling out Apple here because Apple, beyond any other tech company, prides itself on a seamless consumer experience. It\u2019s done a very good job of hiding the technical aspects of its products  for the sake of user friendliness : \u201c It just works. \u201d Well, not in this case. Finally, I\u2019m so sorry \u2014 I only hope that the people behind this  go to jail , and that the mass awareness of that fact prevents anyone else from attempting something this vile. They\u2019re to blame foremost. Best, Alexia Tsotsis Co-Editor, TechCrunch", "tags": "[\"iCloud\", \"Mobile\"]", "url_image": "", "title": "A Letter To Jennifer Lawrence"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/incubated-turner-media-camp-2/", "content": "A few years ago, a couple of execs at Turner Broadcasting decided they wanted to find a way to better help startups looking to create media-focused products. And so, they created an incubator called  Media Camp  to guide those companies to success. Launched at SXSW 2012, Media Camp was founded to identify interesting startups and help them build products that big media conglomerates would actually want and use. Up until that point, most startups entering the space had good ideas, but didn\u2019t know how large media companies worked, or who they should contact to even get their foot in the door. Today, the program is a joint initiative led by Turner Broadcasting in San Francisco and Warner Bros. Entertainment in Los Angeles. Media Camp is a 12-week program designed to connect founders with high-level mentors who know the business and can point them in the right direction when it comes to building products that work with media companies\u2019 existing workflows.  And while it provides all the same mentorship that one might expect from a typical accelerator, it has one distinct advantage for startups looking to build tools around the media business. As part of Time Warner, the program can help make introductions to the decision makers within that company. Since it\u2019s focused on media specifically, startups that go through the program can find early customers and get the market validation they need. Either that, or they can get feedback from media companies about what they can do to improve their products and get them adopted in the market. On the flip side, Time Warner gets an early look into upcoming startups and technologies that its units can use to improve their businesses. And in some cases, they are exposed to startups solving problems they didn\u2019t even know they had. Media Camp typically chooses 5-10 companies per class, and looks for those which already have product in the market, or one that is close to launch. To find out more about the incubator, check out the video above. And be sure to watch some of our other incubated videos while you\u2019re at it. This is the sixth episode of a TechCrunch TV series called  Incubated . We\u2019ll have a new episode after Wednesday afternoon for the next two-and-a-half months, each of which will take a look at what it\u2019s like inside some of the top accelerators in the U.S. Please join us each week to find out how all the different incubators and accelerators help out the startups that participate in them.

Leto had just taken part in the event\u2019s keynote, which stretched north of two hours. Why would Leto, who won an academy award in 2013 for his performance in \u201cDallas Buyers Club,\u201d take part in\u00a0a technology conference? Simply put, it\u2019s somewhat\u00a0 standard stomping grounds for the Thirty Seconds to Mars frontman . Leto claims dozens of investments in young companies and is the founder of several firms\u00a0himself. While Leto is mostly known for his work in entertainment, he has also put money into Surf Air, Zenefits and Wish. His best investment? According to Leto, Nest, a company that  Google picked up for $3.2 billion . I hadn\u2019t been\u00a0aware that Leto was\u00a0involved with Nest in any capacity. In fact,  Leto\u2019s CrunchBase profile  lists only four investments to his name. The musician is therefore one of the quieter celebrity investors out there. There is no shortage of famous\u00a0money in tech at the moment, or star\u00a0hype, but it tends to be noisy. In Leto\u2019s case, somewhat to the contrary, I doubt that many in tech know that he\u00a0is so active. That might be because Leto has also founded three companies, which, along with his film and touring schedule, could\u00a0restrict his ability to chat too much about where he shunts his dollars. The three firms are The Hive, which focuses on social media management for brands; The One and Only Golden Tickets, which is now operates\u00a0under the Adventures in Wonderland moniker; and\u00a0VyRT, which deals with the live-streaming of concerts, but remains in beta. All told, Leto is perhaps the only celebrity technology investor that I don\u2019t actively dislike. That and he\u2019s a decent human in person.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/fox-sports-go-nfl-2014/", "content": "Once upon a time, it was rare to see sports streamed online, but that\u2019s no longer true. As more and more audiences are turning to their laptops, mobile phones and tablets to watch streams of their favorite sports teams, broadcasters are increasingly making those matches available on those devices. The latest is Fox Sports, which will  stream 101 NFL games  it has rights to this season. Streaming is nothing entirely new: After all, DirecTV\u2019s NFL Sunday Ticket service has provided streaming access to all out-of-market games over the last several years. Part of the reason for that is that it had exclusive rights to those streams, and well, they provided a reason for NFL fans to sign up \u2014 whether or not they had a satellite dish. Over time, the appetite for streaming has expanded to other networks when available. ESPN has made its Monday Night Football games available online and through its WatchESPN app for tablets. And the last three Super Bowls have all been streamed \u2014 first by  NBC Sports , then by  CBS , and last season by  Fox Sports . Apparently that last live broadcast was successful enough for Fox Sports to decide to do it some more. This year, the network will be streaming 101 NFL Games on its website and tablet app. Those scheduled streams include 97 regular-season games and four playoff games that will take place over the course of the 2014 season. There are a few caveats to this announcement. The first is that viewers will have to authenticate \u2014 that is, sign in with their cable or satellite provider to prove that they pay for television access. The second caveat is that while Fox Sports will live stream more than 100 games altogether over the NFL season, only in-market games will be available to viewers. That is, if you\u2019re a Philadelphia Eagles fan in San Francisco like I am, you\u2019re out of luck \u2014 you\u2019ll be stuck watching 49ers streams through the app. For the majority of NFL fans rooting for the local sportsball team, however, the new streaming option will be a welcome way to catch the game, even when they can\u2019t be in front of the big screen on Sunday afternoon.", "tags": "[\"nfl\", \"Media\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/fox-sports-go-e1409780955139.png?w=738", "title": "Fox Sports Go To Stream 101 NFL Games Online And On Tablets This Season"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/dwnld/", "content": "Last week, we reported that Pinterest investor Fritz Lanman was pursuing the  company builder model  for creating startups and  working on two different companies simultaneously . Today one of those companies, called  DWNLD , is launching to help web publishers quickly, easily, and affordably build awesome native mobile apps. DWNLD hopes to cash in on the trend of more and more publishers turning to native apps in lieu of mobile web sites. The platform was built to help media companies or brands or really anyone with a web presence to build those apps and submit them to the Apple App Store and Google Play market. \u201cThe lines between the web and native apps is blurring,\u201d Lanman said in a phone conversation. Nowadays, there shouldn\u2019t be any reason why a web publisher can\u2019t also publish a native app, except maybe development costs. But DWNLD is set to change that. Once registered, DWNLD can import a publisher\u2019s web content into its content management system and generate a native app based on it. Apps are customizable, enabling publishers to define the overall look and feel based on a variety of different templates, fonts, and color combinations. They can also incorporate a number of different types of rich media, including photos, videos, links, GIFs and the like, and display them natively. Before this, rolling out such an app would usually require a big upfront investment in development. But DWNLD wants to make the creation of these apps affordable, and also to simplify the cost structure so that anyone can build one. Instead of charging for the cost of app creation, DWNLD has a flat cost of $15 per month. For many publishers, that follows the usual hosting model that they are already used to. Publishers can also monetize their apps by enabling advertising, of which DWNLD takes a cut. And that\u2019s how the company really hopes to make money. While it will make some revenue from the SaaS business, the bigger opportunity is around aggregating a bunch of native apps and creating an ad network around them. According to Lanman, the startup is optimizing for the ad business and hoping to create a sort of Google AdSense for mobile apps.  While DWNLD is launching to the public now, the company has spent the last several months getting partners lined up, mostly recruiting high-profile bloggers to try it out. It\u2019s coming to market with 200 publishers signed up and using it for their native apps. Founded in 2012, the company now has a staff of 14 employees and has raised $2 million in seed funding. The company was co-founded by Lanman, who is a former Microsoft exec turned angel investor and entrepreneur. He had previously invested in companies like Square, Pinterest, FiftyThree, and Teespring, and  sold his last company , Livestar, to Pinterest last year.   He\u2019s joined by Alexandra Keating, who runs day-to-day operations of the startup as CEO. She was former VP of marketing at Thrillist Media, where she helped the company see 500 percent year-over-year growth. Prior to that she founded a not-for-profit fundraising platform called GoFundraise, which she sold in 2008.", "tags": "[\"Fritz Lanman\", \"DWNLD\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dwnldpic2.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dwnldpic1.jpg?w=1024&h=727", "title": "DWNLD Gives Web Publishers A Platform For Building Affordable, Customizable Native Apps"},

The  Asus ZenWatch  offers a slightly different take on the design of an Android Wearable, and features some pre-loaded software and gesture controls that also set it apart from similar devices like the LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live. The ZenWatch features a sandwich-like design with a rose gold-colored middle layer and stainless steel top and bottom, with a brushed surface around the face. It has a 1.63-inch 320\u00d7320 AMOLED display with a slight curve to its surface, and a 1.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor, as well as 512MB or RAM and Bluetooth 4.0. There\u2019s a heart rate sensor on the underside, and it uses standard user-replaceable 22mm watchbands. IP55 water and dust-proofing should help it fend off accidental splashes and rain, and it has a 9-axis sensor for tracking activity and movement.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/galaxy-note-4/", "content": "Samsung  has just unveiled the fourth generation in its surprisingly popular phablet series. Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Galaxy Note 4. In terms of design, the Galaxy Note 4 is very similar to the  Galaxy Note 3 , save for a few small details. For example, the metal strip that runs along the side of the device is a bit more straight-edged, and is the same color as the phone itself, which comes in a number of different color flavors. The phone also has the same faux leather removable back. On the inside, however, the new Galaxy Note seems like a solid upgrade over earlier versions. In terms of the display, it sports a 5.7-inch 2560\u00d71440 Quad-ultra HD \u201c2K\u201d display, measuring in at 518 pixels per inch, which is a 30 percent increase from the GalNote 3. The company also gave special attention to the cameras, with the addition of Optical Image Stabilization in the 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a 3.7-megapixel camera (f/1.9) on the front equipped with special selfie-centric features. For instance, users can use the heart-rate monitor on the back of the Note to snap a photo, and software allows for a \u201cPanorama-style\u201d selfie where users can angle the phone to include everyone in the shot. Samsung also promises better low-light performance out of both the front- and rear-facing cameras. Under the hood, the GalNote 4 has a 3320 mAh battery with special software to help with fast charging. (In the video below, I accidentally said 3300mAh battery, which is incorrect. Forgive me.) The company assures us that users will be able to get to 50 percent battery life in 30 minutes of charging, along with an ultra-low battery saving mode. Samsung has also improved the GalNote\u2019s iconic S Pen stylus, which now acts more like a mouse. Of course, the company made changes to the S Pen so that it would be more natural and fluid for handwriting, but it now has the ability to drag and drop as well as copy and paste more easily. This comes in handy with the new Galaxy Note 4, as the smartphone-tablet hybrid offers more customizable multitasking options. The phone still sports the same split-screen technology, but now with the option to change the size of windows, minimize them, and move them around to different parts of the display. Samsung isn\u2019t being very forthcoming when it comes to pricing and availability, but they did say we can expect to see the GalNote 4 in stores come this fall.", "tags": "[]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/galaxy-note4-b-roll-2-00000511.jpg?w=738 http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g", "title": "Samsung Unveils The Galaxy Note 4"},

Unlike most smartwatches, the Gear S has two very special features. The first is a curved 2-inch, AMOLED display, and the second is 3G connectivity, allowing the smart watch to be used independent of a smartphone. The curved display measures in at a 260\u00d7480 resolution, and under the hood you\u2019ll find a GPS sensor, an accelerometer, gyroscope, UV detector, barometer, and heart rate monitor, alongside 4GB of internal storage and 512MB of RAM. It\u2019s all powered by a dual-core 1.0 GHz processor and Tizen, Samsung\u2019s own mobile operating system. Users can receive messages, emails, get directions, and even make calls all with the smartwatch itself, which is being debuted alongside the Samsung Circle Bluetooth headset. Initial reactions are that it\u2019s huge and clunky, though that won\u2019t be as much of a problem for you big strapping men as it is for me. The curved display is interesting and eye-catching, and gets the job done. Since the Gear S has its own 3G modem, users now need a QWERTY keyboard to shoot off messages when necessary. However, the QWERTY keyboard and predictive text may take a while to get used to. In my ten minutes with the watch, I was unable to quickly and effortlessly type a message correctly. Luckily, the Gear S comes equipped with S Voice, Samsung\u2019s voice transcription software. All in all, the Gear S is an interesting option in the smart watch landscape, but we\u2019re still unclear on pricing.

Those include RideScout, an app which allows North American users to search for and compare time and costs across various ground transport options, and Intelligent Apps, the company behind mytaxi, a German Uber/Hailo competitor that operates primarily in Europe. Moovel is looking to use both brands to add to its \u201cfamily\u201d of transportation apps, with RideScout operating as a subsidiary of Car2Go in North American, and continuing to operate over 300 partners for variety of choice in ride decision-making \u2013 though the Smart car powered ride-sharing service will probably feature prominently among its options. Mytaxi is one of the first taxi-hailing apps, having launched in Germany back in 2009. The brand has attracted 10s of millions of downloads across its global footprint, but the acquisition will help moovel expand it further internationally. Mytaxi has yet to make major inroads in the North American market, despite presence in the Washington, DC area, and the bulk of its focus remains in Germany for now. This consolidation of transport apps abroad resembles somewhat the acquisition spree going on in the food delivery startup space, and could make for some interesting action when the European conglomerates start facing off more and more against U.S. startups like Uber. Uber, for its part, faces a nationwide ban in Germany, which is mytaxi\u2019s stronghold.

The company today introduced the Samsung Gear VR, a headset that plugs into the Galaxy Note 4 to create a virtual reality experience not unlike that of the Oculus Rift.  The Gear VR itself is filled with various sensors, while the processor and the battery of the Galaxy Note 4 handle all the heavy lifting. After removing the visor, users can plug in their Galaxy Note 4 into the device and the 2k display will take over.  Samsung is tapping Oculus to power the device, which uses Oculus\u2019 VR store to give users access to content. The Gear VR will also be able to give users access to concerts, 360 degree tours of cities and locations, among other things.  Since the Gear VR splits the resolution of the Galaxy Note 4\u2019s 518ppi display, the experience isn\u2019t super HD. However, in the short time we had to try out the headset, it certainly offers an interesting virtual reality experience for those who are looking for a more lightweight option.  Oculus and Samsung worked diligently on this together, which gives Oculus further distribution in the market with the Oculus store and gives Samsung some credibility and established content hitting a brand new market for the first time.  At launch, the Gear VR will come with some special content including a tour of Tony Stark\u2019s Lab (as a part of a partnership with Marvel\u2019s Avengers: Age of Ultron). IMAX is also offering trailers and samples of films to watch in a virtual theater, as well as 360-degree live-action 3D VR for perormances like Cirque Du Soleil and Zarkana.  Vevo is also offering access to more than 100,000 HD music videos, live concert events, etc.  Why is Samsung releasing a VR headset now? That\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. I suppose the only answer is that it can. The phones are powerful enough to act as the guts for this thing and I could foresee a time when VR headsets are essentially dumb pieces of plastic that you slip your phone into to create a similar experience, with all the in-phone sensors doing all the work. Until then, you have his. VR is an exciting option for big electronics companies, with Facebook buying Oculus, Google getting more deeply immersed in Glass, and now Samsung hopping in the boat. Time will tell how the category matures, but in the short term, you can look for the Gear VR in the fall. No pricing information has been released.

But it\u2019s just one part of a broader ecosystem of applications customers use to manage their accounting and finances, so the company is partnering with a dozen launch partners to simplify the transfer of information between clients. The SMB market is becoming increasingly fragmented, with businesses realizing the power of the cloud and breaking out of using siloed, one-size-fits-all solutions that are mostly tied to desktop-based software. In doing so, businesses are increasingly mixing and matching a bunch of different vendor platforms to find the right combination of tools. To limit the amount of information that needs to be re-entered across multiple platforms, companies like ZenPayroll are opening up to work better with their peers\u2019 systems. For ZenPayroll that means the introduction of an API to make that process seamless. ZenPayroll already had partnerships with other players like Intuit, Xero, and Freshbooks to bring payroll information into its system. But now it is opening up integration with a wide variety of other back-office tools already used by many of its customers. The API is being used by a dozen other SMB providers that span a wide range of tools. They include BambooHR, BayPoint Benefits, Employee Navigator, Expensify, Kin HR, hCentive, inDinero, Insynctive, Maxwell Health, Receipt Bank, SimplyInsured, and Zenefits. With those partners on board, ZenPayroll customers will be able to connect it to their payroll, benefits, and human resources systems. By doing so, they\u2019ll be able to enter information like benefits or hours worked into one application, and then have it automatically synced with ZenPayroll. ZenPayroll is growing fast: The company is seeing $1.1 billion in annual payroll go through its system today, an amount which has doubled from just four months ago. Being able to seamlessly connect with other services should help it find more clients, or at least get more businesses on board. ZenPayroll has raised $26 million in funding since being founded a couple of years ago, which includes a  $20 million round  from earlier this year.

The service, which allows you to find and order 3D prints from printers in your area, is similar to other services like  MakeXYZ  and  3DLt  but is already available overseas. Founded by former 3D Systems employees Brian Garret and Bram de Zwart, the site was one of the first global 3D printing solutions. They\u2019ve processed over 30,000 3D prints and have about 7,100 printers in 140 countries. To use the service, you simply choose your area, upload a model, and ask for a quote. The 3D printer owner then prints things out and gets it to you via post or sneaker net. It\u2019s a tough market but the team prides themselves on speed. \u201cWe\u2019re very fast and average delivery time has dropped to 1.2 days from submission to pickup/shipping,\u201d said Garret. \u201cCompetitors like  Shapeways  still take about a week for their fastest materials, and much longer for special materials.\u201d They\u2019ve also worked up some excellent partnerships and are already embedded as a service provider for some 3D modeling products. \u201cWe\u2019ve got partnerships in place with Autodesk (direct print button to our API) as well as consumer brands like Fairphone. Through these partnerships we drive about 40% of our orders, this is where we see most of the growth in the coming year,\u201d said Garret. \u201cBram and I started 3D Hubs out of frustration that existing 3D printing services weren\u2019t living up to the promise of 3D Printing. As soon as we launched, the idea really resonated with printer owners around the world who enjoy printing, but often run out of things to print for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201c3D Hubs offers them a way to earn money and collaborate on cool maker projects.\u201d The Series A is led by Balderton Capital. Mark Evans, General Partner at Balderton Capital, will join the 3D Hubs board. The company is opening new offices in New York at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and will improve its API penetration. \u201cWe are developing new features that will make the experience of ordering a personalized 3D print similar to traditional e-commerce platforms,\u201d said Garret. Printing and selling small batch hardware is going to be the future. These guys are right at the cusp.

Thus, the super clever name.  The Galaxy Note Edge has almost identical specs to the Galaxy Note 4, save for a slightly smaller battery and, of course, a random display hanging off of the side of it. The Edge display works entirely independently of the regular screen, while at the same time offering contextual controls based on whatever app you\u2019re using.  For instance, if you\u2019re in the camera app, the camera\u2019s controls will appear on the Edge display. If you\u2019re using the S Note app, controls for drawing, text, etc. will show up on the Edge display. If you have music playing, controls for seek, volume, and pause/play will show up there.  However, if you\u2019re simply just using the phone like normal, the Edge display will show a list of your favorite apps. The tray of apps is totally customizable via the settings icon on the bottom of the Edge display.  The Edge display (Super AMOLED) is independently scrollable, and gives you options to see a ticker for sports, stock quotes, weather, and more. At night, users can have the phone display off and turn on an \u201cAlarm Clock\u201d mode that shows the time on the edge display only, mimicking a table-side alarm clock.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/apples-two-factor-authentication-doesnt-protect-icloud-backups-or-photo-streams/", "content": "One of the common bits of advice you\u2019ll see people giving you  around this celebrity picture hack  is to enable two-factor authentication on your accounts \u2014 including Apple\u2019s. That\u2019s good advice, but it wouldn\u2019t have protected any of these celebrities and it doesn\u2019t protect the other accounts that are compromised by hackers that are able to obtain an Apple ID email and password. While Apple has offered two-factor authentication on accounts for some time now, there is an omission in that system that hackers are taking advantage of. iCloud backups are not protected by two-factor authentication, and can be installed on new devices with only an Apple ID and password. Of course, that\u2019s still a very big \u2018only\u2019. Your email and password are as much protection as almost any service on earth offers you by default \u2014 and once a hacker obtains those you\u2019re probably in trouble in any case. The early evidence, and Apple\u2019s  statement on the matter , indicates that hackers obtained passwords through guessing security questions, social engineering, phishing or other \u2018targeted\u2019 attacks \u2014 rather than a leak of the password data itself by Apple. Notably, access to iPhone backups can also be accessed using an authentication token (a file created by iTunes) which can be obtained using malware or phishing \u2014 and which does not require a password at all. But two-factor is billed by Apple and many security experts as a way to protect yourself from simple password theft. It requires that you have a code sent to your physical device to confirm that yes, it is you logging in to your Apple account. However, Apple\u2019s two-factor solution is actually incomplete. It does not cover many other iCloud services, including backups. In fact, the only three things two-factor secures in iCloud  are the following : It does not, however, make you enter a verification code if you restore a new device from an iCloud backup. And that\u2019s the design \u2018feature\u2019 that hackers are taking advantage of here. Once they gain access to an Apple account, some are\u00a0using the login and password to \u2018restore\u2019 an iCloud backup using an application by Elcomsoft called the  Phone Password Breaker  \u2014 exporting data including photos and more to a folder which they can then sift through. Even if the hackers do not actually download the entire backup \u2014 or if there is no backup on the account \u2014 they still have access to a user\u2019s Photo Stream at this point, which is also not protected by two-factor authentication. So, even if all of the people who have had their photos compromised had two-factor enabled, their iCloud backups and Photo Streams would still be accessible. If you thought this was a vulnerability that was fresh and new for Apple \u2014 that it wasn\u2019t aware of this loophole \u2014 you\u2019d be incorrect. The fact that Apple\u2019s iCloud backups are not protected by two-factor authentication has been known for over a year. Security researcher Vladimir Katalov (who works at Elcomsoft, imagine that)  presented his findings  on the iCloud protocol, including what portions of iCloud are protected by two-factor authentication, at the Hack In The Box security conference late last year \u2014 and  posted about the issues  as early as May of last year. Not to mention coverage by  Ars Technica ,  ZDnet \u00a0and again  today by TUAW . The best thing that Apple could do right now is expand its two-factor security to cover all iCloud services, not just account resets and purchases from new devices. Asking someone to enter another form of identification on a restore or when logging into an account from a new device or location would be good next steps. It\u2019s important to note that there  have been\u00a0 rumors  of Apple increasing the scope  of two-factor to include other iCloud services, but those have not yet been implemented. On the user front, all of the standard pieces of advice still apply. Use a complex password, do not share it with anyone, use a private email if at all possible for your ID \u2014 one you also don\u2019t share with anyone. Don\u2019t click on links in emails if at all possible, don\u2019t share personal information over social networks if at all possible and use completely incorrect or random answers to password reset questions. For users that don\u2019t have two-factor enabled at all, doing that will definitely add a layer of security to your account if you don\u2019t have it already \u2014 but if thieves are able to obtain your password then that will not protect your backups at this time. In its statement about the hacking incidents, Apple recommended two-factor authentication to increase account security. Apple did not respond to a request for information about expanding its two-factor authentication.", "tags": "[\"iCloud\", \"two-factor\", \"Apple\", \"Security\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-02-at-5-58-00-pm.png?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-02-at-3-20-56-pm.png?w=680&h=502", "title": "Apple\u2019s Two Factor Authentication Doesn\u2019t Protect iCloud Backups Or Photo Streams"},

This brings the total amount raised this year alone by Delivery Hero to\u00a0 $520 million , and the overall\u00a0total raised to $635 million. Delivery Hero says it is the highest-ever round of financing raised by a food delivery company to date. Suddenly, Rocket Internet\u2019s typically supersized funding rounds seem very regular:\u00a0 FoodPanda raised\u00a0$60 million \u00a0in August. We have reached\u00a0out to Delivery Hero to ask whether this latest round of financing was made at the same valuation, or if it\u2019s creeped up higher. They have yet to answer but we\u2019ve heard that the large, publicly-listed food delivery companies are a good a point of comparison. UK-based  Just-Eat , which\u00a0went public earlier this year, is currently valued at\u00a0 $2.71 billion (\u00a31.65 billion) . U.S.-based  Grubhub , meanwhile, is valued at  $3.21 billion . This latest round was led by existing investors\u00a0Insight Venture Partners and Kite Ventures, and also includes the backing of a new party, the Swedish\u00a0investment company Vostok Nafta, which has  invested  in a number of Russian companies like Avito, GetTaxi and Yell.ru. Delivery Hero says the money will be used to \u201cinvest in existing markets\u201d \u2014 naming specifically the UK and Germany in a statement on the new round. It\u2019s unclear if the focus will be on organic growth or more acquisitions along the lines of Pizza.de,\u00a0the German rival that Delivery Hero gobbled up only weeks ago. I wonder if we will be seeing more acquisitions, given that food delivery\u00a0is a relatively mature market that is ripe (excuse the pun) for more consolidation. \u201cIn a few of our markets we haven\u2019t reached market leadership yet and we will use this investment to achieve our goal of becoming the clear number one in each market we operate in,\u201d CEO\u00a0Niklas \u00d6stberg, said in a statement. What this mammoth round shows is that, while there may be some concern that tech startups in Europe may find it harder to raise money\u00a0in light of the shrinking economies in certain European markets, the door remains open for those demonstrating\u00a0growth and innovation. The new funding will also help Delivery Hero stave off any immediate need to raise money through the public markets right away. There\u00a0may be some logic to that: with Zalando, Alibaba and Rocket Internet all potentially listing soon, and food delivery compatriots Just-Eat and Grubhub already public, there is a question mark over whether investors would want to sustain yet another e-commerce listing like Delivery Hero at the moment, in which case waiting at least until 2015 and raising privately makes more sense.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/why-apple-should-be-more-transparent-about-security/", "content": "It\u00a0seems that Apple has\u00a0gotten embroiled in a security scandal of one sort or another every few months. It dodged Heartbleed but was hit by\u00a0the  very embarrassing \u2018goto fail\u2019 bug . It was\u00a0called out for not  adequately documenting the uses of diagnostic tools \u00a0that could have been used to collect data from user devices.\u00a0Late last year researchers showed off a method for  siphoning data via the charging port of iOS\u00a0devices . A year ago a researcher  went public with a method for accessing\u00a0Apple IDs  of developers after he says he got no response from Apple. And then there was this week\u2019s celebrity photo hack, which may have been able to be prevented by  making iCloud backups more secure . In each of these cases, Apple fixed vulnerabilities, released support notes or patched bugs. But in almost all cases, and many others over the years, the company was\u00a0as opaque as possible about explaining the details of security issues, reluctant to admit to them publicly and very unresponsive to independent security researchers. That leads to misunderstandings and FUD\u00a0about the extent of the problems and the risks involved for users. This needs to change or it will continue to happen. Apple as a company has shown to have deep concern for the\u00a0 privacy  of its users. It very frequently goes against\u00a0common business wisdom to protect user information from third parties. One example of this is Apple refusing to share subscriber info with the publishers of iPad magazines.\u00a0Apple sources, including both past and present employees, have never shared any information with me that indicates that Apple is interested in anything less than complete user privacy. But though the company appears on many levels to have the best interests of users at heart, it does not appear to be expending\u00a0the same kind of deep, detail-oriented effort on security as it is famous for in many other product areas. Apple will obsess over the degree of chamfer on a button, but somehow shoots itself in the foot with\u00a0silly security mistakes over and over again. I can completely appreciate (and understand) that Apple doesn\u2019t want to make snap judgments about possible security vulnerabilities. Going public with issues before there is a fix, for instance, is a real way to cause more problems than you solve. That\u2019s where the concept of responsible disclosure comes in. But it\u2019s also not taking full advantage of the resources it has available to it, namely independent security researchers. Many security researchers that I speak to are frustrated with the amount of transparency and communication when it comes to reporting vulnerabilities to Apple \u2014 and getting them fixed. \u201cI would like to see Apple open the lines of communication between their security engineers and security experts in the field,\u201d says researcher Jonathan Zdiarski. \u201cThe only avenue many security researchers feel like they have to get big issues addressed is the public forum. The largest company in the world should have an open communication with the experts who evaluate their software for third parties and governments.\u201d One practical step Apple could take is to either participate in or establish its own paid bug bounty program \u2014 in a public or vetted format. This would compensate hackers and security researchers for finding and reporting bugs to Apple. Many of Apple\u2019s contemporaries already do this, including Microsoft, Yahoo and Google. Currently, Apple publicly identifies people who expose hacks \u2014 recently it even began acknowledging members of iPhone jailbreak teams which discovered vulnerabilities that led to those jailbreaks being possible. But it could definitely afford to incentivize those researchers, or at the very least develop a way to communicate with them more openly and effectively. And it\u2019s not just external security efforts that Apple should work to improve. The \u2018 iBrute\u2019 hack that was able to rapid-fire passwords  at one of Apple\u2019s Find My iPhone login interfaces was an example of something a hard-core security audit would likely have caught. Likewise the \u2018goto fail\u2019 SSL bug that left users vulnerable to traffic snooping for months. There have been many\u00a0examples of Apple not heeding early warning signs from the security community about possible vulnerabilities. We should expect better from Apple, as it should itself. This is a company\u00a0whose devices are used by hundreds of millions of people including government employees and world leaders. The question I\u2019ve been asking myself over the months since the SSL vulnerability debacle has been \u2018why?\u2019 Why is a company who is generally very well-rounded operationally, and like it or not, produces extremely well-liked and complex devices so bad at communicating about security? The answer I\u2019ve come up with, and this is just a personal theory, is that Apple thinks about security communications in the same way that it thinks about product communications. In other words, it plays its cards incredibly close to the chest at all times by default. These tactics have served it well in the consumer products arena, creating a frenzy of attention around the releases of new devices and services. And that\u2019s great; I don\u2019t mind a little mystery around products as a consumer, even though my job as a reporter is to figure out what Apple could do next and decide whether that\u2019s important enough to talk about publicly. But in security, this kind of ivory tower comms strategy is a losing game, especially as smartphones become an increasingly information-rich repository of our personal lives. Security will become a feature that is as important as any other widget on our future devices, whichever company they come from. As an industry leader, Apple should re-evaluate the way that it handles security, both internally and externally. Be open, be communicative, be honest and we\u2019ll all be\u00a0better off.", "tags": "[\"transparency\", \"security\", \"Apple\", \"Security\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/apple-transparency-security.jpg?w=738", "title": "Apple Should Be More Transparent About Security"},

As  first reported by Re/code\u2019s Kara Swisher , and confirmed by AOL, Susan Lyne is stepping down from her role as CEO of AOL\u2019s brand group, which includes sites like Engadget, Joystiq and, yes, TechCrunch. Lyne will be taking charge of a venture fund within AOL that backs women-focused companies, while responsibility for the brand group will be split between two people \u2014 Maureen Sullivan, who will continue to run lifestyle and personal finance sites, as well as AOL.com, and Luke Beatty, who will be in charge of the sites covering tech, autos, and entertainment. Beatty  joined AOL almost exactly a year ago , where he most recently served as the brand group\u2019s head of product. (He\u2019ll continue to lead the new product team.) He previously founded Associated Content, and also worked at Yahoo (which acquired Associated Content) and as a managing director at Techstars. His new title is President, Media Brands.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/mozbii/", "content": "Now on Kickstarter,  Mozbii  is a wonderful stylus that lets kids turn the world into their crayon box. It has already surpassed its $30,000 funding goal, with the campaign ending on Sept. 27. To be sure, there are other color-picking styluses out there, but Mozbii has several features that makes it suitable for children as young as two. The stylus is shaped like a lollipop with a flexible neck. Its RGB color sensor is embedded on one side of the head, with a tiny color-picking button next to it. To use it, kids just need to press Mozbii\u2019s head against an object, and that puts enough pressure on the button to activate it, which means that even toddlers, who have limited motor control, can use the stylus. An LED light on the other side of the \u201clollipop\u201d head lights up when the stylus successfully picks up a color. Once they pick a color with their Mozbii, it is saved automatically in Mozbii\u2019s app, and they can use it to doodle or fill in coloring pages. Mozbii\u2019s magnetic charging head is also easy for children to use.  Both the Mozbii stylus and app were created by Taiwanese startup  Ufro , which was founded by Jeremy Shu. Shu, a former operations director at Apple, was inspired to create learning products for kids by his own children. When his son and daughter switched from a bilingual Mandarin-English school to a school that taught exclusively in English, they had a hard time adjusting and their grades began to slip. Instead of pressuring them to study harder, Shu encouraged his children to take up hobbies, including sports, music, and art. He realized that having a creative outlet helped his kids relax and, in turn, their report cards began to improve. \nMozbii is supposed to help nurture children\u2019s creativity while motivating them to interact with the world around them, Shu says. I got to try out Mozbii in Ufro\u2019s office and was impressed with its ease of use and accuracy. It works best when used with vivid colors, like the purple of an orchid flower. More subtle colors, like skin, are harder to duplicate exactly, but Mozbii still captures variations in the tones. In the app, kids can save palettes of up to twelve colors each for use in future drawings. One of the main things that I like about Mozbii is that it encourages children, who spend an increasing amount of time on tablets, to explore their environment and the objects around them. For example, the sensitivity of Mozbii\u2019s RGB color sensor lets them capture several different shades of pink and yellow from the skin of a peach, or they can make a palette by gathering up their favorite toys and using it with the stylus. In addition to the coloring app, Ufro plans to develop other educational apps that work with Mozbii, including apps for reading, numbers, and music. Mozbii already has a finalized prototype, so Shu is confident that the campaign will be able to deliver to the first 100 super early bird backers by next month, while other backers will receive their styluses in November. Pledges that include a Mozbii start at $64.

There\u2019s nothing quite like\u00a0wasting away time playing games on your iPhone all in the name of better health. Enter brain training and \u201ccognitive science\u201d startup  Memorado , which today is disclosing a $1.3 million seed round it actually closed back in March (it appears that the brain-fit company forgot to tell anybody!). Backing comes\u00a0from Sunstone Capital and a number of angels, including the founders of Zalando, StylistPick, Wimdu, Fyber, and Hitfox \u2014 all Berlin-based investors. The Wimdu connection is also fitting;\u00a0Memorado\u2019s founders,\u00a0Marius Jeuck and\u00a0Marius Luther are also co-founders of the Rocket Internet-founded company. Like others in the brain training space, Memorado produces a suite of mini-games, delivered via its website and app for  iOS , that it says can help you improve your cognitive abilities. The idea is to offer a \u201cgym for the brain,\u201d encouraging you to visit Memorado often, like you would a gym, including a business model that features\u00a0various subscription tiers and personalised programs for those that want to work-out their cognitive muscles more regularly. \u201cYour brain is your most important asset in today\u2019s world,\u201d says Memorado co-founder Marius Luther, who was also previously a healthcare consultant at McKinsey. \u201cYet there is no good way to work it out and improve cognitive functions.\u201d In addition, he says that 47 per percent of humans develop a form of dementia at some point in their lives and the best known prevention is mental activity. \u201cBy building the \u2018gym for the brain\u2019, we want to provide a structured, engaging and fun program to trigger mental activity and improve cognitive abilities,\u201d he says. To that end, six months since launch, Memorado has already garnered over a million members, though it doesn\u2019t say how many of these are paying customers. Its iOS app\u00a0has also attained the top position in the Education category of Apple\u2019s iOS App Store in 22 countries, including the United States, UK, Germany and France. As I said, these type of brain training mini-games, which first became popular on the Nintendo DS, if my rapidly improving memory serves me correctly, are addictive. However, despite early success, Luther candidly describes the concept of a \u201cgym for the brain\u201d as only ten percent there, both for Memorado and competitors, such as U.S.-based Lumosity, which he says helped to establish the category. Problems he and his ten person-strong engineering team are tackling include personalisation so that a training program will train a user\u2019s weakest areas hardest, ensuring brain training translates to progress in daily life, and creating an experience that is still fun after years of training. \u201cSince my days as a healthcare consultant at McKinsey, I wanted to find a project that would marry up healthcare and tech. Narrowing down, we were looking for something that could positively affect the health millions of people but would not need years of drug development and would not be dependent on external parties such as health insurance,\u201d explains Luther, when I ask him why he and co-founder Jeuck decided to focus on brain training mini-games. Furthermore, the brain training space \u201cstuck out\u201d because it is a tech-first solution to a healthcare problem, and is truly mass market, appealing to people of all ages and from anywhere in the world. \u201cWe could really identify with our mission \u2018make people smarter\u2019,\u201d he adds.", "tags": "[\"sunstone capital\", \"Europe\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/thumbnail.png?w=738", "title": "Brain Training Startup Memorado Raises $1.3M"},

Britain\u2019s burgeoning digital economy has a huge role to play in meeting both of these challenges, and that\u2019s why Coadec\u2019s manifesto is right to emphasise the importance of digital startups as well as the need to foster digital skills.\u201d Matthew Hancock MP (Minister of State at the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills) commented: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt there is yet more to do and we will scour any proposals to make Britain the best place in the world to start and grow a business.\u201d In the main it calls for: \u2022 Cutting taxes for entrepreneurs, including reducing National Insurance Contributions (NICs) for startups that volunteer to teach coding, \u2022  Retraining those made redundant by disruptive technology, rather than blocking innovation through protective regulation, \u2022  Opening the doors to tech talent from outside the EU by restoring the post-study work visa and allowing VCs to sponsor employees on behalf of startups, \u2022  Backing the UK\u2019s FinTech companies by creating a legal framework for Bitcoin, and digitising the identity checks required for Anti-Money Laundering procedures. The full list of recommendations can be found in the  Manifesto here  or below Robin Klein (Partner, Index Ventures) said: \u201cThe progress made during the past few years towards making the UK the best place in the world to start and run a company has been significant. There is however much more to be done. This manifesto is packed with practical ideas which in the aggregate would make further meaningful strides towards the UK\u2019s goal.\u201d Damian Kimmelman (Founder and CEO, DueDil) said: \u201cIf adopted, these recommendations would give us the edge we\u2019ll need in a hyper-competitive global economy.\u201d  Jon Bradford (MD, Techstars London): \u201cOver the last four years, the government has done a huge amount to nurture the startup ecosystem\u2026 But now is an important juncture: if we are to continue on this path of growth, we need to consolidate the accomplishments to date.\u201d Taavet Hinrikus, Co-founder of TransferWise, said: \u201cWithin a decade, technology will have transformed the world as we know it. Banking, for instance, is already changing, and London appears \u2013 at least for the moment \u2013 to be leading the way. However, there is so much more the next government could do to secure this.\u201d Tom Raffe (Founder, Screenburn) said: \u201cComputing in schools is an issue I\u2019m particularly interested in as we need to continue to produce first class developers in order to complete on a global level.  It will be essential to have a thorough review of ICT education in schools in order to plan for the future.\u201d Coadec is sponsored by Google, TechHub, iHorizon and Intuit.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/zappos-clone-zalando-to-file-for-657m-ipo-in-frankfurt-in-2014/", "content": "Rocket Internet , the Berlin-based global e-commerce incubator, is widely believed to be preparing to go public, but in the meantime,  Zalando , a Zappos-style European fashion portal with 13.5 million active customers\u00a0that Rocket\u00a0nudged\u00a0out of the nest around a year ago, is now spelling out its own IPO intentions. The German company\u00a0will list in Frankfurt sometime this year, and it will sell between 10% and 11% of its shares to raise around \u20ac500 million ($657 million). Overall the valuation of Zalando is estimated to be up to about  \u20ac6 billion  ($7.9 billion). The news comes as we gear up not just for Rocket Internet\u2019s own listing, but also that of Alibaba, the China-based e-commerce leviathan that is widely expected to break records when it lists in the U.S. While there have been murmurs about this about to happen  since May , the new developments are now\u00a0confirmed. Zalando itself has now set up a section of its website  related to IPO news  (although it has yet to publish anything there, at the time of writing, and it will legally be impossible for people outside of Germany to access it anyway). And \u00a0Kinnevik , the Swedish conglomerate that is the largest shareholder in Zalando, has also issued a statement, which  can  be read by those of us outside of Germany. That statement provides details on Kinnevik\u2019s investment \u2014 between 2010 and today Kinnevik has invested 5.5 Swedish kronor ($784 million) in Zalando for a 37% stake in the company (a rundown of other investors and all publicly disclosed\u00a0rounds of funding are\u00a0 here ). And it also gives insight into the\u00a0financial state of Zalando. In 2013, Zalando made \u20ac1,762 million ($2.31 billion) in revenues, growth of 52% over the year before. But at the same time, it posted a net loss of \u20ac116.6 million ($153 million) that year. For the first two quarters of this year, Zalando has been mainly break-even (net loss of \u20ac28.9 million in Q1, net income of almost the same amount in Q2). Fulfilment costs and marketing costs have come down somewhat over the last few years for Zalando but so have the company\u2019s margins, which are now around 40%. Zalando\u2019s growth, but equally cost of operations and net loss, point to some of the challenges ahead for this company specifically, as well as the wider market for e-commerce businesses. The economics of e-commerce\u00a0remain a game that relies very much on scale \u2014 both in terms of production and fulfillment of orders. And companies like Zalando \u2014 they include Amazon-owned Zappos and Amazon itself \u2014\u00a0compete on low prices and fast service, but this has a knock on effect on a\u00a0company\u2019s distribution costs and margins. Produce or sell too little, and you are in the red. The way out of this challenge\u00a0seems to be to be able to produce more and more to both\u00a0bring down production costs and also to increase the volume of returns if not the margins themselves. For Zalando, that has seen the company diversify into a number of different areas in the category of fashion. The company today aggregates products from 1,500 brands and says it offers 150,000 product choices for its customers in 15 countries.", "tags": "[\"Fashion\", \"Kinnevik\", \"Rocket Internet\", \"Zalando\", \"eCommerce\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-10-30-09.png?w=738", "title": "Zappos-Style Fashion Portal Zalando To File For $657M IPO In Frankfurt In 2014"},

For just $119 , you can snag the new  Encore Mini , which runs Windows 8.1 on a teeny-tiny 7-inch, low-resolution screen. Inside is a quad-core Intel Atom CPU, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and a microSD card slot. The 7-inch screen is of the 16:9, 1024 x 600 variety. There are of course front- and rear-facing cameras, a micro USB 2.0 port and 802.11n. The specs won\u2019t sell this tablet but the price will. The estimated ship date is September 17. Initially announced by Microsoft as the Encore 7 back at Computex in June, the Encore Mini is about the least expensive Windows 8.1 device on the market.  HP also recently announced a 7-inch tablet , but it sports a $199 MSRP \u2014 to its credit, though, the Stream 7 has a higher-res screen. Smaller Windows tablets were slow to hit the market, but the form factor is clearly picking up steam.  Several Chinese makers  also announced their 7-inch WinTel tablets. With small, low-resolution tablets, users shouldn\u2019t expect to use apps in Window 8\u2019s desktop.

The acquisition is aimed at beefing up AVG\u2019s mobile credentials, with Location Labs offering a swathe of security products for\u00a0phone users \u2014 including antivirus, cloud backup plus a series of family-focused controls so that parents can, for instance, lock out phone use during school hours, view a log of phone activity, and get alerts when a phone is used for certain activities or to contact certain people. The company has also established a range of carrier partnerships in the US to promote its software. Location Labs \u00a0now has more than 1.3 million monthly paying subscribers for its mobile safety and security products. Its software\u00a0has a penetration rate of 2.7 devices per household as multiple users within families are engaged with it. The company is\u00a0profitable, and\u00a0currently generates around\u00a0$33 million in annual revenue.\u00a0It has\u00a0raised around\u00a0$26 million in funding, with its\u00a0last\u00a0funding round being back in 2007. A spokeswoman for AVG said the appeal for the company to acquire Location Lab is to expand its consumer product range, and especially to grow on mobile. The carrier partnerships and integration are\u00a0also a draw for AVG.\u00a0It\u00a0is likely Location Lab will continue to operate independently post-acquisition, she added.

This acquisition significantly accelerates AVG\u2019s mobile strategy in this area. \u201cAccording to industry estimates, the number of mobile-connected devices will exceed the world\u2019s population by the end of this year alone.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/android-wear-is-getting-gps-and-the-ability-to-talk-to-other-bluetooth-accessories/", "content": "Google\u2019s Android Wear platform is going to gain more powers on a continuing basis, thanks to frequent significant updates, the Android team has revealed. Upcoming features planned for Android Wear in the immediate future include support for GPS on devices, instead of having to rely on connected smartphones, and the ability to work with other Bluetooth wearables in potentially interesting ways. Previously, Google had mentioned that it was  introducing an API for third-party watchfaces , and the team reiterated that it was coming along with the two new features mentioned above in a  new interview with CNET . \u00a0The GPS feature will require that Android Wear smartwatches have GPS chips built-in, which early hardware does not, but it will mean that you can run apps like activity trackers and leave the smartphone at home, while still charting your run. As for its new communicative powers, Google is being more vague about what exactly this will entail, but they did offer up the example of an Android Wear device talking to your Bluetooth headset directly, meaning you can play back music from your watch directly instead of requiring a smartphone to pair with the headset. This, again, will help it become more autonomous, expanding the feature set of Android Wear wearables when not in Bluetooth range of their host phone or tablet. Direct Bluetooth pairing powers opens up a range of possibilities, however, from controlling smarthome devices to supporting direct input from keyboards. The Android Wear team plans to ship \u201cseveral\u201d updates to the platform before the end of the year, including one this week that will improve navigation and some of the voice control features. Overall, the team is aiming for a fast and furious update pace for the Wear platform, as the \u201csimpler\u201d nature of the watch devices vs. smartphones and tablets makes that kind of schedule possible. This will hopefully allow Google to avoid the kind of fragmentation it\u2019s been criticized before on phones and slates, too. Android Wear is about to be able to stand more solidly on its own two feet, and that\u2019s good news for developers and OEMs building for the platform. The platform is off to a slow start, but Google seems committed to putting in the time needed to help it slow-burn it\u2019s way to success \u2013 or it wants to do everything it can to give that impression ahead of Apple\u2019s big wearable reveal, which should happen next Tuesday.", "tags": "[\"wearable\", \"smartwatch\", \"Bluetooth\", \"Android Wear\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/android-wear-hero.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/lg-g-watch.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "title": "Android Wear Is Getting GPS And The Ability To Talk To Other Bluetooth Accessories"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/location-based-video-editing-app-clinch-heads-to-the-deadpool/", "content": "Mobile video app  Clinch \u00a0(not to be confused with  Klout\u2019s Cinch )\u00a0is heading to the deadpool, but the company itself lives on, developing products for the digital advertising space. First introduced in 2012, Clinch\u2019s app  automatically\u00a0threaded together video clips  and photos based on location, allowing users to then customize the resulting mobile video further by selecting their own backgrounds, themes, and music. What was different about this app was that it didn\u2019t just allow for automated movie creation, it also allowed for collaborative movies, mixed with content from others around you. The app was ideal for use cases like concert footage, sports events, conferences, and more. However, the app was in a competitive space, where there\u2019s not really been a breakout hit.  Animoto  is probably one of the better-known of the \u201cautomated video\u201d variety, and it\u2019s still alive and kicking, though it\u2019s arguable that it never became a household name the way social networking and messaging apps like Snapchat or Whatsapp, for example, have become \u2013 and certainly not in the way video-sharing apps like Instagram and Twitter\u2019s Vine are known today. Plus, there\u00a0are a number of other apps offering similar mobile video editors, including  Flipagram , which makes short videos from photos,  Sharalike , and others. And of course, any automated movie-making solution will have to go up against the built-in mobile tools for creating movies, like Apple offers with iMovie, or Google+ offers with its GIF-like \u201cAuto Awesome\u201d feature. HTC, Samsung, and Blackberry also offered their own automatic \u201cstory making\u201d apps,  TechCrunch previously noted . In an email from the team at Clich sent out late Sunday night, the company explains that it has evolved beyond its consumer-facing app over the years, and is now focusing on its core technology development, Smart Programmatic Creative solutions for the digital advertising business. The company offers a\u00a0patent-pending HTML5 ad-rendering engine that combines location, user and product information in real-time, and renders the ad on the client-side browser with dynamic, always up-to-date content.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/netflix-taps-facebook-to-let-you-privately-recommend-content-to-friends/", "content": "Netflix  has  just launched  a new social recommendation feature that lets you suggest content to friends without posting publicly to social media. After connecting your Netflix and  Facebook  accounts, Netflix will now ask users a question each time they finish watching a movie or TV show: Do you want to suggest this video to a friend? If so, users are able to choose from a list of Facebook Friends (in thumbnail form) or search by name, and add an optional message. But this is where things are a bit different than you might expect. Instead of posting that as a status update or sending it to your friends\u2019 Newsfeeds, Netflix will simply alert those friends the next time they sign in, notifying them that you have suggested a certain television show. If that friend hasn\u2019t connected their Netflix and Facebook accounts, Netflix will send the user a private message using Facebook Messenger. Friends can thank you for your recommendation, and you\u2019ll be alerted when they watch your show. This kind of feature may achieve in one fell swoop the same social TV experience that others have been trying at for years. However, there is a UX issue with typing on many set top boxes and consoles, so that may deter some from searching through hundreds of Facebook friends.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/03/groupon-nips-at-yelp-and-opentable-with-time-based-deals/", "content": "Groupon  \u2014 the daily deals site that has been\u00a0expanding to include other e-commerce services for local businesses \u2014\u00a0is today unveiling \u00a0the latest product in that strategy. It is  adding a new feature  that will let businesses offer deals to users to be redeemed at a specific time in the day. Groupon says that the ability to set up and buy time-based deals are being rolled out first to restaurants and other food and drink establishments, starting today, with the intention to expand that to other categories like beauty salons, auto\u00a0shops, educational classes, events\u00a0and more. Time-based deals will effectively work with Groupon\u2019s existing deals platform: customers can book reservations (or later, appointments) via Groupon.com, or via its mobile app. When you come to redeem it, you no longer need to present a voucher as you would with an open-ended Groupon deal purchase. A merchant can integrate the time-based option with their own reservations system, or with Groupon\u2019s, the company tells me. There is no additional fee to use the feature. The idea behind time-based deals is relatively simple, and\u00a0relatively common: while no one will deny that any business is good business,\u00a0what can be challenging for a retailer\u00a0that serves customers is to keep the flow of service constant without labor-crushing peaks, and unprofitable troughs. It\u2019s a problem that e-commerce companies have been trying to tackle for a while now. Remember Pirq, the company that was working on a loyalty offer to be used internally by Apple employees? They are\u00a0also  addressing the same problem  of how to create more predictably\u00a0consistent footfall. The benefit for Groupon in offering this is twofold. On the consumer side, it gives the company another route into offering more flexible options for customers \u2014 who can still browse the open-ended offers, but can now also get options for time-specific bookings, which may give them more peace of mind that they will actually use the service. On the B2B side, it gives Groupon the benefit of one more touchpoint with merchant customers. Given that companies like Yelp, OpenTable and more are all also looking to \u201cown\u201d the booking and ushering relationships with restaurants and other local merchants, having one more feature like time-based deals potentially could give Groupon a competitive edge over these others. The added control and differentiation seems to be the benefit\u00a0that Groupon is playing up. \u201cOur new booking technology provides merchants even greater control over their deals to match the needs of their business and offers a tremendous customer experience,\u201d said Julie Szudarek, SVP, Local Deals, in a statement. \u201cAnd as more and more businesses list their reservation and appointment inventory with us, it gives our customers another reason to always check Groupon first.\u201d (Getting an edge right now is important for the company, after it reported a  disappointing quarter  with a loss per share of $0.03.) Groupon tells me\u00a0that its time-based deals solution was developed in house, \u201cinspired by our past reservations experiences with Savored and  Groupon  Reserve.\u201d It was some of the team from Savored, the reservations startup Groupon  acquired in 2012 , that built the feature. The company has\u00a0been trialling its solution in a test in Chicago. If you live in the city and use Groupon, you may have come across the initial pilot,  with the city\u2019s popular\u00a0Frontera Grill \u00a0or 100 other food-and-drink businesses. \u201cThey\u2019re making it really easy for us to fill tables during off-peak times, which generates more revenue for the restaurant and gives us more opportunities to attract new customers and turn them into lifelong fans,\u201d said Rick Bayless, owner of Frontera Grill, in a statement.

The curriculum and its massive dissemination is the first test for a new online education startup,  EdCast , launched by serial entrepreneur and Menlo Ventures venture partner,  Karl Mehta . \u201cThis approach of online education is the future of the area I\u2019m dealing with, which is global sustainable development,\u201d says Sachs. \u201cWe need a mass scale-up in understanding of these issues to confront big challenges like climate change.\u201d To achieve that scale-up, Sachs is leveraging his position as director of the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Solutions Network, an organization comprised of hundreds of universities and think tanks created by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Through EdCast Sachs will distribute a curriculum he\u2019s designing including an introduction to the issues that climate change negotiators will face as they ready for the December 2015 Paris negotiations and, eventually, the mock negotiations among the thousands of students that are part of the  SDSN\u2019s network of universities . In all, there are some 200 member institutions and think tanks that are part of the organization. Already the  38 universities around the world  that form a Global Association of Masters in Development Practice will offer the inaugural course from Professor Sachs, \u201cThe Age of Sustainable Development\u201d, as part of their core curriculua. The class is also available for free to interested students around the world. When Sachs first taught the course last year, through Coursera, some 50,000 students enrolled globally. \u201cStarting in January we\u2019ll put on the table a draft agreement of the kind the governments will be negotiating at the end of the year and we\u2019ll spend several weeks in a massive online virtual negotiation,\u201d says Sachs of the 2015 curricula he envisions. As an advisor to the UN on climate change negotiations, Sachs is uniquely positioned to bring whatever the world\u2019s students approve to the table in Paris. The collaboration between Sachs, and EdCast founder and chief executive Karl Mehta began in Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum. Mehta was coming off a stint as one of the first White House Innovation Fellows and had been working on EdCast as a way to transform higher education. \u201cThe best way to make a difference and an impact was to make sure we can strengthen the foundation of education using the technology we have to make quantum jumps,\u201d Mehta says. He envisions what he calls a multiversity, with hundreds of campuses interconnected through public and private hosted clouds on the EdCast platform so that students can pick and choose a curriculum from the best courses on offer at major institutions around the U.S. and around the world. It\u2019s a vision that aligns well with Sachs\u2019 notions about the future of education, and while EdCast is announcing its first project with the SDSN, the company has a network of educational institutions that extends far beyond the organization. \u201cThere\u2019s over 500 universities worldwide that we\u2019re working with,\u201d says Mehta. \u201cAnd over 1,000 professors.\u201d Investors in Mehta\u2019s new company include  Menlo Ventures ,  Stanford StartX , where it was accelerated, and the  New Schools Venture Fund , launched by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partners Brook Byers and John Doerr and social entrepreneur Kim Smith. \u201cWe have universities across the developed and developing nations that are using it,\u201d says Mehta. \u201cThere is tremendous demand from universities in the developing world. And we can bridge the gap between a developed and a developing country\u2019s educational system. This public, private, and multi-institutional platform can bridge this gap.\u201d Ultimately, both Mehta and Sachs see the EdCast platform and its collaboration with SDSN as a way to bring education to potentially millions of students. \u201cSolving the world\u2019s greatest challenges in climate change, poverty, hunger, disease begins with a solid analytical foundation,\u201d said Sachs, in a statement. \u201cFree online education will tremendously democratize higher education and accelerate problem solving for sustainable development.\u201d Photo via Flickr user  Intel Free Press", "tags": "[\"karl mehta\", \"Jeffrey Sachs\", \"Education\", \"edtech\", \"EdCast\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/12838515965_64937648c1_h-1.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sachs.jpeg?w=204&h=306 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/mehta.png?w=254&h=239", "title": "Sustainable Development Goes Massively Online As EdCast Launches With Sustainability Expert Jeffrey Sachs"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/zumper-zapp/", "content": "Apartment listing startup  Zumper  has spent the last several years building apps to help connect brokers and property managers with prospective tenants and vice versa. Today it\u2019s launching a new application called Zapp that will simplify the process of not just finding, but also applying for, their next apartment. Zumper, which was a  Disrupt Battlefield finalist , began by building  tools aimed at real estate professionals  to help them quickly list their available properties. And on the consumer side, it provides a way to search for apartments and\u00a0 request viewing times from brokers . Now available on the web, iOS and Android, Zumper has closed the loop between renters and brokers. But there\u2019s more value it can provide to both sides, starting with helping prospective tenants to easily and quickly apply for apartments and run their credit scores through Zapp. With Zapp, the company has created a standard credit report and rental application that will enable renters to fill out their information once and then be able to submit it to brokers and property managers. To get the service working, Zumper has partnered with Experian to handle the credit check portion of the application. It\u2019s free to fill out an application and $10 to run a\u00a0credit score, which is a huge discount over most rental application processes. Once it\u2019s filled out, users can resubmit it for other listings they might want to apply to. Listings on the Zumper platform will be marked with a badge to show they will accept the Zapp rental application. Users can also share their applications for listings that aren\u2019t guaranteed to take them. By doing so, the company hopes to get more brokers signed up to accept them. To start, the Zapp application will be rolling out in beta on the web and Android, with an iOS app coming soon. Listings accepting the application will also be limited to the San Francisco Bay Area, and on about 15 percent of listings there, before rolling out nationally later on this year. Zumper has raised about $8 million in funding from investors that include Kleiner Perkins, Dawn Capital, NEA, the De Wilde Family Trust, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock, CrunchFund, and The Experiment Fund.", "tags": "[\"real estate\", \"Zumper\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/angellist-homepage-e1409677155885.png?w=738", "title": "Real Estate Startup Zumper Launches Zapp, So Renters Can Apply For Apartments In-App"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/tocomail-for-gmail-offers-parental-controls-and-monitoring-for-teens-first-gmail-account/", "content": "A company called Tocomail  earlier this year launched a mobile application designed to be kids\u2019 first email service , built with the parental controls and protections such an app would require, while allowing kids to write simple messages and send drawings to pre-approved family and friends. Now Tocomail is targeting a slightly older crowd with the debut of another app called  Tocomail for Gmail , aimed at teens. The new app is very much a repurposing of the technology Tocomail had already developed, but instead of providing its own email-like service it is instead functioning as a Gmail client. Similar to the earlier product for kids, the new application allows users to send and receive messages in a simplified interface, and even includes the same drawing board which is now accessible from the \u201cattachment\u201d icon in the Compose screen. Here, you can\u00a0choose add photos from your Camera or Gallery, or make your own drawings. However, unlike the product for the tiny tots, the Gmail client includes an instant messenger too, allowing teens to chat back-and-forth with their friends and family. Most importantly, however, are Tocomail\u2019s parental controls. Effectively, the app is offering a way for parents to allow their children to have a  real  Gmail account while still having some oversight and control over their activity and communications. These controls\u2013an optional $9.99 in-app purchase\u2013are the app\u2019s biggest selling point, or at least that\u2019s Tocomail\u2019s hope given the price point. Parents have the ability to control the child\u2019s contacts list through categories including\u00a0\u201cSafe,\u201d \u201cGeneral,\u201d and \u201cBlocked\u201d categories of contacts. When Parental Controls are switched on, any communication\u00a0outside of the \u201cSafe\u201d list will only happen after the parent views and approves the email message. Presumably, a parent would add other family members or close family friends to the Safe list. Meanwhile, parents are able to supervise the other two lists of contacts. Messages are reviewed by parents in the quarantine box, which is where messages sit until they receive the \u201cokay\u201d to be sent. Since Gmail is restricted to those 13 and older  in most parts of the world , including the U.S., Tocomail for Gmail is aimed at this 13-18 year-old crowd. At the low-end of that\u00a0age range, the app makes more sense, since its interface comes across as a bit more cutesy and juvenile than I\u2019d expect an\u00a0app for teens to resemble. Granted, teens are not too picky about an app\u2019s look \u2013 take, for example, popular apps like YikYak and Snapchat, both which began with very rough, unpolished user interfaces before steadily being upgraded. Tocomail for Gmail  could be a functional solution for proactive parents who are more restrictive when it comes to what their child is capable of doing \u2013 and which apps they\u2019re using \u2013 on the iPhone. But if the child has his or her own iTunes account and the device\u2019s parental controls are off, there are literally hundreds of ways a child could message their friends. I\u2019d imagine that kids would simply self-police themselves while using this app because they know mom or dad is reading their emails, while coming up with alternative means to chat more privately outside of parents\u2019 knowledge. In other words, protective parents should think of Tocomail as not a solution in and of itself, but another piece in a larger suite of tools they use to keep their children safe while on mobile. A cell phone is not a device\u00a0that should just be haphazardly handed over to a child. The process of giving a child their first smartphone should begin with parents configuring the on-device parental controls, having kids sign and discuss their \u201c cell phone contract \u201d (your rules for how the phone is to be used), and parents should pre-install any monitoring apps they want their household to use, whether that\u2019s a family locator like  Life360  or a locator, messaging and social media monitoring solution like  Mammabear . Once the phone is in the child\u2019s hands, ongoing monitoring is crucial, including with the above-mentioned apps or something similar, as well as with  app-monitoring services like AppCertain  to keep track of what kids are installing on their phones.

The  Level In  is a \u201cpremium\u201d in-ear headset, complete with an inline mic and remote that offers volume control on modern Galaxy devices as well as play/pause and track control. It comes in either white or black, with metallic accents, and ships with various earbuds for varying fit and a carrying case. Samsung\u2019s design is a bit overdramatic for my liking with the Level In, as they appear large and bulky \u2013 they seem designed to attract attention, in other words, and perhaps to signal to viewers that the wearer is rocking Samsung buds. The size doesn\u2019t make them overly heavy to wear, but it might contribute to the general discomfort I experienced when wearing these. Somehow, despite presenting a plethora of tip options for various fits of the earbuds, none of those included actually work with my ears, which isn\u2019t a problem I typically have with in-ear type headphones. The squishy memory foam variety come closest, but these still don\u2019t alleviate the slight pain I get in my ears from wearing these for extended periods. Sound quality, when a seal is achieved, is decent, and on par with ear buds in the $100 range. You can still get better sound from buds that are cheaper, however, including the Klipsch S5 series, and those are more comfortable to wear in my experience. The remote controls, especially volume on an Android phone, are nice, but again only real benefits if you have a Samsung Galaxy device. On-ear headphones have to strike a delicate balance in terms of blending comfort with a lightweight design that doesn\u2019t box ears in, and Samsung has managed to create a headset that does that with the  Level On . The soft leather accents on the top band and earcups are extremely comfortable, and look good on the white/tan model I tried out. The Level On also folds up for easy storage, and comes with its own hard shell carrying case. It\u2019s light on the head and in the hand, and it comes with a cable with a built-in remote/mic combo that works with Galaxy devices, and provides basic functionality for other Android devices and iPhones. Overall, Samsung has done well with the design on the Level On, but the metal-look accents and slightly pearlescent paint don\u2019t mask the fact that at base, these are still constructed mostly of plastic, and don\u2019t necessarily have the premium feel of other headphones priced in this range. Audio quality is good, with a somewhat strong bass performance, but get muddy at the top end. They\u2019re generally unimpressive performers, however, and if audio quality is your top priority, other options in this range will serve you better. The  Level Over  is Samsung\u2019s top-of-the-line set, and provide big leather-lined cups that completely enclose a listener\u2019s ears. They look much the same as the Level On, borrowing the same design cues and color styles (though the ones I reviewed came in a piano black) and they also wear quite comfortably. Over-ear headphones are generally more bulky, and these are definitely that, and in fact they add a decent amount of weight, too. They do cover my large-ish ears nicely as a result, however. The problem with the Level Over, which have active noise cancellation, is that this key feature isn\u2019t executed all that well; the internal, rechargeable battery works well, but when on the noise cancellation produces a lot of auditory feedback when connected to a source, and still isn\u2019t quite as powerful at blocking out ambient noise as industry leaders like the Bose QC15. Samsung\u2019s audio quality likewise leaves something to be desired with the Level Over (sound comes through somewhat tinny and lacking the rich quality you\u2019ll get with headphones from companies with more audio chops), but the trade-offs in terms of their complete compatibility with the Galaxy range and in-line controls might make that an exchange worth making. \u00a0", "tags": "[\"Level Over\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_9161.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_9165.jpg?w=1024&h=682 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_9164.jpg?w=1024&h=682 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_9163.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "title": "Samsung Level Headphone Series Review: Galaxy Owners Only Need Apply"},

Until today, the only way to connect an entire home to the same speaker network was to use something called a Bridge, a $50 box that connected directly to your router via Ethernet. Now, however, the system can connect directly to your wireless router, bypassing the Bridge entirely. Why is this a big deal?  Sonos  has long been the whole-home audio system of choice for nerds everywhere. Being able to play different tracks in different rooms (or turn on Party Mode for whole home music) has evolved from a process that required an expensive controller and bridges to a system that uses commodity hardware and your own wireless network. Whereas most hardware companies become more insular and difficult to use because of proprietary systems and architectures, Sonos has made its speakers far simpler. By reducing costs and hardware requirements, Sonos has exhibited some of the most intelligent behavior in the hardware industry. Faced with a glut of tablets and phones they discontinued their original (excellent) remote and support iOS and Android. Now they have further reduced costs and barriers to entry by killing the Bridge in some cases. While not every situation will allow for full wireless streaming, Sonos has made it surprisingly simple to wirelessly connect all your speakers.", "tags": "[\"wireless\", \"updates\", \"Sonos\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_2216.jpg?w=738", "title": "Sonos Kills The Bridge And Goes Almost Totally Wireless"},

So if you were looking forward to getting your paws on the code, you have only four weeks left to wait. That is, if you are not a key Microsoft partner. According  to NeoWin\u2019s Brad Sams , Microsoft is currently providing some partners with access to the operating system ahead of the public.

I\u2019m somewhat excited about Windows 9. This is due in no small part to a vague notion that I have long had that much of what Windows 8 brought to the table wasn\u2019t bad at all, but merely poorly organized, and disjointed. It felt, as it were, something like a bundle of features hung together with string and bits of chewing gum. If Microsoft can distill the best parts of the Metro interface and fuse it to a top-tier desktop experience, I\u2019ll file a corporate request with AOL for a copy to run on my daily driver Macbook Air.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/google-doubles-down-on-productivity-with-google-for-work-rebrand/", "content": "This morning at its San Francisco offices, Google announced a rebrand of its enterprise products, renaming the set of tools and productivity services \u2018Google for Work.\u2019 The new nomenclature\u00a0will stretch across the company\u2019s\u00a0various business tools, with each service picking up a \u2018for Work\u2019 appendage \u2014\u00a0Google now vends Drive for Work, Search for Work, and so forth. Why the new branding? Google indicated that the new naming allows it to leverage brands that it already considers strong, and that the nomenclature makes it simpler to explain what the tools are \u2014 it\u2019s Drive, but for work. (Google\u2019s education-facing efforts\u00a0were\u00a0recently cleaved from other offerings, and given their\u00a0own blog.) Google\u2019s efforts to gain more share in the enterprise and productivity space puts it in direct competition with Microsoft, among other firms. Notably, Microsoft\u2019s CEO Satya Nadella recently came up with a new slogan for his company, saying that it\u00a0would focus on  \u2018productivity and platforms.\u2019  Google seems to agree with that bent. Box, Dropbox and Apple also have irons in this particular fire. Amit Singh, Google\u2019s president of its enterprise efforts, told the media that Drive for Work, the company\u2019s cloud storage play for business customers, is currently picking up around 1,800 new customers per week. He also indicated\u00a0that 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies currently use paid Google for Work services. Google has been  aggressive in how it prices cloud computing, and cloud storage . Given its large data-center profile, the company has the footprint to offer commodity tools at basement prices. Other players, such as Amazon,  have also reduced their prices , as the market itself benefits from lowering input costs. As the revenue that companies can derive from commodity cloud services declines, there is an increasing focus on providing services on top of storage and compute tools. Google seems intent to capture share on both sides of the market. Singh noted that some costs, particularly\u00a0IT costs, are not coming down in keeping with the general arc of Moore\u2019s Law. That, in his view, is due to legacy expenses\u00a0caused by past corporate investments that previously performed well, behaving mostly like an anchor in the current business climate.\u00a0It\u2019s an argument in favor of cloud services in general. The next question for Google is whether it can grow its productivity\u00a0services into a key revenue source. In its  most recent quarter , \u2018Other Revenues\u2019 made up a slim 10 percent of the company\u2019s\u00a0total top line. That figure, however, is growing more quickly than its other incomes, rising 53 percent year-over-year for the quarter, which compares favorably to Google\u2019s aggregate revenue growth rate of 22 percent, again on a year-over-year basis. Google certainly thinks that it can.", "tags": "[\"Amazon\", \"Microsoft\", \"Google\", \"Education\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/google-for-work1.jpg?w=738", "title": "Google Doubles Down On Productivity With \u2018Google For Work\u2019 Rebrand"},

When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple\u2019s engineers to discover the source. Our customers\u2019 privacy and security are of utmost importance to us. After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet.

Workarounds to prevent vulnerability to this kind of attack include, as Apple mentions, selecting strong passwords (like those created using random password generators) and enabling two-factor authentication, which is an option on iCloud.

Today the company is announcing that it acquired  Baseline , another provider of information about movies and TV shows, in a deal worth $50 million. Baseline is a Los Angeles-based company that has a comprehensive database of information about more than 300,000 television and movie projects. Its dataset has catalogues of information from some of the earliest film projects, in addition to news about ongoing projects. That includes filmographies of 1.5 million TV and film professionals to chart the different projects they\u2019ve worked on, as well as historical box office data for about 45 different territories around the world. The data firm had once been acquired by The New York Times company a few years ago, but was spun out and  sold back to its previous owners in 2011 . With the new deal, Baseline\u2019s staff will join Gracenote, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the larger Tribune business. Gracenote\u2019s acquisition of Baseline comes just a week after it announced that it had a new boss. Batter left Dreamworks Animation and Technicolor joint venture M-Go to head up the company, taking over for Tribune digital head Shashi Seth, who has left. Along with the new CEO comes a new strategic direction. While Tribune Digital had made a series of strategic investments and acquisitions under previous leadership, the Gracenote part of the business will look to be more wholly focused on metadata and what clients can do with it. As a result, Gracenote continues to bulk up its data set and list of customers with the acquisition of Baseline. Batter admits that he wasn\u2019t with the company at the start of its acquisition talks with Baseline, but he believes that it fits with the company\u2019s overall mission. Furthermore, he was \u201cin full support and involved in the completion of the deal.\u201d Batter is actually familiar with Baseline\u2019s product offering from his time at M-Go. His former employer used a combination of data from both Tribune Media Services, which is now part of Gracenote, and Baseline, which will become part of Gracenote. That provided M-Go\u2019s digital storefront with advanced filmographies of cast and crew members that customers could use to search and discover movies that they might not have otherwise known about. Baseline will provide a whole bunch of new data Gracenote can sell to clients, but it also offers up a potential new client base. While Gracenote sells its products to consumer electronics manufacturers, video and music service providers, Baseline has a subscription offering that people in Hollywood use to keep track of what\u2019s going on in the industry. In fact, Batter says there\u2019s very little overlap between them, which means there\u2019s an opportunity for each side to grow as together they can provide more data to each set of customers.", "tags": "[\"Gracenote\", \"Entertainment\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/gracenote-baseline.png?w=738", "title": "Gracenote Acquires TV And Film Data Provider Baseline For $50 Million"},

There are two new smartphones, a new fitness and life logging wearable, and a new smartwatch (which ditches Sony\u2019s homegrown OS for Android Wear) in the mix. Sony Z3 \nSony\u2019s new smartphone is coming hot on the heels of the Xperia Z2, which was revealed earlier this year. The Z3 doesn\u2019t completely render the Z2 obsolete, however, and is more of an iterative evolution of the previous flagship, with a 5.2-inch 1080p screen, and a 20.7-inch display plus waterproofing, but it has a different frame with more rounded corners, a new camera with a high-ISO 12800 sensor and a 25mm wide angle lens. The Snapdragon 801 processor is clocked at 2.5GHz, too, which improves on the one found in the Z2 and should make this peppier. It launches this fall, but full details aren\u2019t yet known around regions and pricing. Z3 Compact This boasts many of the same specs as the Z3, but with a shrunk down 4.6-inch display, with 720p resolution. That will likely mean lower costs, but Sony hasn\u2019t revealed any specifics around that or launch timelines yet. SmartBand Talk This follow-up to the SmartBand offers lifelogging, which combines activity tracking with other contextual clues and device use to show you not just how you\u2019ve been exercising, but much more beyond that. This model also packs a speaker and mic so that you can use it to field calls from your phone, and it has a 1.4-inch always-on e-ink display for power conservation and visibility in any lighting. It has IP68 waterproofing, and comes in black and white at launch. SmartWatch 3 The new SmartWatch is Sony\u2019s first foray into Android Wear devices, and packs a 320\u00d7320 1.6-inch display, with IP68 waterproofing, and microUSB charging. It has 4GB of local storage, its own GPS sensor in addition to an accelerometer, compass and gyroscope, and can also perform the same lifelogging functions as the SmartBand Talk. Both it and the Talk will launch this fall for 250 euros and 160 euros respectively. No word yet on U.S. launch or pricing. Sony\u2019s IFA announcements show a company that\u2019s willing to iterate faster to match the pace of the current mobile industry.

Underneath the hood, there\u2019s an APS-C Exmor\u00a0CMOS sensor with 20.1 megapixel resolution, and Sony\u2019s Bionz X image processor, which offers low noise on an area-specific basis for better low light shots. The QX30 has greater zoom than any previous QX-series accessory, with a landscape-grabbing 24mm at the wide end and a tight 720mm equivalent at the\u00a0narrow\u00a0end. It includes optical image stabilization to reduce shake motion effects even at the top of the zoom range, and it has a digital zoom feature that allows users to extend zoom to a factor of 60x. 10FPS continuous shooting and lock-on AF make this a prime candidate for action shots, and it captures full HD video at 60fps. Sony\u2019s QX range\u00a0still represents some of the weirdest gear in the mobile world, and there are no competitors out there, but Sony must see some value in the line and decent customer response if it keeps introducing new devices. The QX1 line especially should prove interesting, as it gives NEX and DSLR users a way to move away from dedicated camera devices and into a mobile-first solution, which could begin to erode those latter categories even further.", "tags": "[\"camera+\", \"QX1\", \"Sony\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/qx-series.jpg?w=700 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-03-at-10-37-00-am.png?w=1024&h=567", "title": "Sony Unveils The QX1 And QX30 Lens And Camera Sensor Add-Ons For Smartphones"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/where-you-are-is-who-you-are-even-if-it-is-china/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note: \u00a0 Paul Rosenzweig is a senior adviser to  The Chertoff Group ,\u00a0 a global security advisory firm that\u00a0advises clients on information security, including cloud computing, \u00a0and former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy at the  U.S. Department of Homeland Security .\u00a0 Where your cloud data is stored is, increasingly, critical to determining who controls it. Though many around the globe have become concerned about data storage in the United States, there are worse alternatives. Imagine, for example, if your personal data were stored on a cloud server in China, a nation-state actor well known for conducting cyber espionage against U.S. businesses and surveillance of its\u00a0own population. Soon, you will not have to imagine any longer \u2013 that will be reality. For the past year, the world of cloud computing has been in a state of turbulence, mostly caused by the various Edward Snowden revelations about American surveillance activities. One of the recurrent topics is the growing requirement for data localization \u2013 that is, the idea that data must be stored in a particular geographic location so that it is subject to the laws and jurisdiction of that country. The localization requirement is thought by some to be a way of resisting external surveillance by other nations. Because of these concerns, there have been proposals in Europe and Brazil to require the domestic storage of data.\u00a0 In a related effort in the United States, Microsoft is  fighting a battle  to resist American government efforts to access data stored on Microsoft servers overseas. In short, the trend is, haltingly, toward a rule that where your cloud data is physically stored defines who controls it. Thus far that battle has, principally, been a struggle within Western countries and couched as a question of law for the benefit of civil liberties and consumer privacy. But that\u2019s not the only reason data storage requirements are being implemented. More authoritarian countries are using data localization to their own ends \u2013 as a means of control over civilian populations; continuing the status quo; and maintenance of a despotic monopoly on power. Though Western companies doing business in authoritarian states instinctively resist these requirements, in the end, data localization in a repressive country is often the cost of doing business. Apple\u2019s recent experience in China is a cautionary tale . According to TechCrunch, Apple has agreed to use Chinese-based servers to store iCloud data in China. In public, Apple put a brave face on the move, asserting that Chinese-based data storage is intended to \u201cincrease bandwidth\u201d and \u201cimprove performance\u201d for its mainland China customers. Perhaps so. But observers are justifiably skeptical. The Chinese government, after all, has voiced national security concerns about Apple\u2019s overseas storage of data, raising the specter of NSA surveillance. While a useful sham, these expressed concerns allow China to advance its own domestic policy agenda. Chinese law already requires the domestic storage of local bank and telecom data for security purposes \u2013 and as a means of monitoring the domestic population. Apple\u2019s agreement to domesticate its data in China is part of that larger trend. To be sure, Apple says it encrypts the data that it stores on Chinese telecom servers. But we know that encryption by a cloud service provider is only as effective as its ability to resist government demands for decryption. In Western nations, those demands typically come in the form of legal process where the cloud service provider has an opportunity to protest before a neutral judicial officer. In more despotic systems, like China, the decryption order will often take a more coercive form. Hence the promise of encryption is, at best, a modest road block and, at worst, a chimera. Apple\u2019s decision is, as a business matter, completely understandable.\u00a0 When the largest country in the world demands particular structures as a condition of market access, it is unreasonable to expect any corporate actor to resist. Nevertheless, the consequences of Apple\u2019s move to domestic storage need to be carefully examined. It is already standard policy for most corporate executives traveling to China to leave their personal electronics at home. But until now the concern has been with the surreptitious installation of malicious software and the theft of intellectual property by semi-official government hackers. Now, for Apple users in China, the architecture of the data storage has cut out the middleman. Data uploaded to the iCloud is vulnerable to exploitation without the need for malicious infiltration. Instead, users who bring their own iPhones or iPads may have their data copied directly from Chinese telecom servers at the behest of the Chinese government. The vulnerability is particularly acute for U.S. government officials who bring their own devices to China for personal use. The temptation, as always, is the convenience of a readily accessible device. But for the unsuspecting government official, even the compromise of seemingly insignificant personal data can, in the end, have adverse impacts. Sadly, Apple\u2019s decision means that BYOD in China must end. Whereas China was previously\u00a0a\u00a0\u201cwild west\u201d of malicious activity, it is becoming a \u201cclosed shop\u201d of digital storage and exploitation. The trend toward data localization increasingly metastasizes into aberrant pathologies that support authoritarian regimes. And, in the end, Internet freedom and privacy suffer.", "tags": "[\"NSA\", \"privacy\", \"cloud storage\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/shutterstock_162383249-e1409464978659.jpg?w=738", "title": "Where You Are Is Who You Are Even If It Is China"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/the-new-era-of-smart-dining/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:   Rajat Suri is the founder and CEO of  E la Carte . The restaurant industry has been around for a long time \u2013 since the dawn of Western civilization itself. Starting in Ancient Rome, some of the earliest known\u00a0public restaurants, called thermopolia, were local hot-spots where the citizenry\u00a0would go to socialize, be waited on, and fill their stomachs after a hard day\u2019s work. Although our way of life has undergone a complete metamorphosis into today\u2019s modern society, restaurants themselves have changed very little. The basic guest experience today is fundamentally the same as it was so many centuries ago in Rome\u2019s thermopolia. Software is changing all of that. Just as the rapid evolution of software is transforming how we live at home (think Nest), how we drive in cars (think Google) and how we travel in airplane cabins (think Virgin America), software is also dramatically transforming how we eat at restaurants. In restaurants, there is\u00a0an entirely new consumer-facing software layer of apps and services being deployed as we speak. For example, tablets with sophisticated software for guest ordering and payment, are being placed on every table at major brands like Applebee\u2019s, the largest casual dining concept in the country. Waitlists are being automated by  NoWait  and  NoshList , online ordering being made ubiquitous by  OLO  and mobile payment is now finding its way into fine-dining restaurants by  OpenTable . Big data and sophisticated algorithms can now be leveraged in real time to optimize operational processes like waiter steps of service, improve guest experience and drive superior returns. Restaurants themselves will start to differentiate based on the software-enabled experiences they offer to guests. The new era of what I call \u201csmart dining\u201d has begun. What changed? PCs have been around for over 30 years and the Internet has been around for 20. But the real tipping point was the 2007 mass commercialization of the iPhone, which made the use of rich software applications trivially easy for consumers on mobile devices, through simple touch gestures. Finally we could experience the magic of great software on a plethora of modern consumer interfaces like Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android. It was only a matter of time before this explosion of technology would find its way into the restaurant industry. In fact, the National Restaurant Association found as much as 63 percent of restaurant guests have relied on tech to do things such as place orders, make reservations, look up restaurant locations, and view menus and nutritional information. This number only seems likely to increase as millennials, the first generation of true digital natives, enter the working world and start to expand their purchasing power and market influence. Restaurants in the smart dining era will function very differently from the classical restaurant we have become ingrained to. Guests will not simply interact with their favorite joint through human engagement and physical interfaces like paper menus, but also through virtual interfaces like tablet software and mobile phone apps. While some may lament a perceived decline in human interaction, the truth is that in the smart-dining era waitstaff will be unshackled from rote functional tasks like having to remember toppings on a burger and will be able to focus on interactions with the guest that are more memorable and authentically personal. Restaurant operators will also make data-driven decisions that not only account for their back-of-house but a myriad of factors such as individual employee performance and guest demands. And the guest will enjoy the fact that they have more control and convenience than ever before, with powerful tools like diet and nutrition recommendations at their fingertips. Restaurants will need to wholeheartedly embrace smart dining or risk their brands quickly becoming stale. Consumers today expect speed, convenience and modernity. For example, in the iPhone era, consumers are quick to abandon experiences that are even milliseconds slower than the alternatives. How will they react when some restaurants make them wait for several minutes longer than the competition? And whereas operators may switch out their POS systems once a decade, consumers are more accustomed to tech experiences like phone and tablets that are upgraded every year. How will they react when some restaurants offer experiences that are obviously more obsolete than others? It seems certain that smart dining will fundamentally change the lives of both restaurant workers and patrons worldwide. It is an exciting time to be involved in food hospitality; future generations will look back and see the advent of this smart dining era as a pivotal turning point in the restaurant industry\u2019s long and storied history.", "tags": "[\"food\", \"Restaurants\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/bar-1.png?w=738", "title": "The New Era Of Smart Dining"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/31/investor-pavel-curda-dumped-by-euro-accelerators-after-sleazy-emails/", "content": "Pavel Curda, the European Angel investor and \u2018mentor\u2019 who became the centre of a media maelstrom after  admitting to emailing point-blank requests for sex to tech business women  at a conference, has been shunned by the tech accelerators he  continues to list  as working with him. Curda has now been dumped by at least three accelerators, as well as losing his role as a writer with tech blog, The Next Web. The furore followed reports that outlined in detail how he had sent  emails with  \u201cI am not leave [sic.] Berlin without having sex with you. Deal?\u201d to at least two women at the conference after meeting them in a purely business environment. The row exploded after both women, incensed at his behaviour, went public with the media, including TechCrunch. Seedcamp, Europe\u2019s best funded venture accelerator, issued a statement saying: \u201cAs you\u2019ll have gathered, Pavel has been involved with Seedcamp in the past \u2013 he mentored at two of our events. We were shocked and saddened to hear about his behaviour and our thoughts are very much in congruence with the folks at TNW and TechCrunch. Clearly, we in no way endorse this type of behaviour and suffice to say, we won\u2019t be working with Pavel again.\u201d Alex Farcet, Co-founder at Startupbootcamp in Berlin, said: \u201dThis man is not a mentor at Startupbootcamp and if he was then we would immediately throw him out\u2026 [This is] totally unacceptable behaviour which no one should tolerate.\u201d Following that, Startupbootcamp also issued a  statement in a blog post saying : \u201cCurda is no longer affiliated with any of the Startupbootcamp programs. His behavior is completely unacceptable and absolutely not tolerated here. We do not wish to publicly shame Curda or draw any more attention to the women, but we also believe that the best way to deal with sexual harassment in this industry is to speak openly about it. We applaud the women for their courage in coming forward and speaking out, and encourage raising awareness through open dialogue.\u201d Agnieszka Meller, manager of the Starter Rocket acceleration program in Gdansk, Poland, said: \u201cI would like to publicly condemn Mr. Curda behaviour and inform that we will not continue any cooperation with him\u2026 Mr. Curda is no longer a mentor of Starter Rocket program.\u201d Neeraj Mehta, co-founder of  RockYourPaper in Tallinn , Estonia,  said : \u201cPavel was on our advisory board a while ago, however on our very first meeting he asked about hookers, and I was taken by surprise. That was the time I had warned a lot of startup incubators in Europe about his behaviour and to be careful.\u201d Curda has also been dumped by Deutsche Telecom\u2019s accelerator hub:raum, Inkubator Starter in Poland, and Hubraum Krakow. Despite continuing to list them, he has not worked with Starcube in Czech Republic or Seedcamp for two years. However, some elements of the tech community in the Czech Republic where Curda is based have given him something of an easier ride. Journalist  Milos Cermaks , Editor in Chief of Ihned.cz recently  met  with Curda and subsequently wrote a  soft-ball article  describing Curda as a \u201cpopular consultant and investor\u201d in Eastern Europe and largely writing off his actions as drink-fuelled and committed in the heat of the moment. Another, Jiri Sekera, a Prague-based advisor to the CEE event WebExpo who runs the Prague based web agency  Refresh ,  tweeted : \u201cOne would almost got the impression that @pavelcurda is the first person in the history of mankind, which offered the opposite sex casual sex, right?\u201d Most of his Czech respondents disagreed with this assessment, pointing out that Curda was the more \u2018senior actor\u2019 and therefore had more responsibility to behave appropriately in a business setting and context. Later Sekera  tweeted : \u201cStrange \u2026 when I was given unwanted offers for non-binding sex from rich and influential women, TechCrunch did not write about it \u2026\u201d (Update: Sekera says his tweets were taken out of context and  points to his Facebook comment : \u201cI definitely support and admire Geshe and Lucie in fighting against serious sexual harassment, but this was just a personal drunk message followed by unnecessary lame lies. I think smart answer like \u201cEnjoy the rest of the life in Berlin then.\u201d would be more than enough. And power of this public coming-out could be used for many better opportunities.\u201d He later  added : \u201cIts hypocritical to act like this is not a regular part of people\u2019s sex lives. Especially in these circles.\u201d) When asked his reaction to being banned from working with the above accelerators, Curda emailed us the following: \u201cI apologised to both of the great girls I met in Berlin, before the tech event, for my rude messages. There was no business deal or business offer to them in Berlin or afterwards. Some in the media got this wrong.\u201d [In fact this contradicts Curda\u2019s previous statement that he had engaged only in wholly business-oriented conversations with the women, and later offered mentorship to one of them after she had confronted him about his emails to complain]. Though Curda\u2019s  unfortunately crass attempts at apologies  are  something , as previous reports noted they only came after he\u2019d  claimed his email was hacked  ( twice )and only after the women confronted him offline and online. He added: \u201cHowever, this has been a big lesson learned. And I will change my behaviour. The tech industry should change \u2014 sexual harassment is a big topic. There is a lot of hypocrisy, too. I will tell my Berlin story and collect the experience of others. I will publish it in a book I will call \u2018Ich bin ein Berliner\u2019.\u201d He plans to continue as an Angel investor. TechCrunch has no further comment, other than to say, that \u2014 as a general observation \u2014 being stupid and wrong is really no way to go through life.", "tags": "[\"Europe\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/pavel-curda.jpg?w=738", "title": "Investor Pavel Curda Dumped By Euro Accelerators After Sleazy Emails"},

One obvious solution is to use a case like the  Mophie , but I don\u2019t like increasing the size of my phone. Another is to carry a battery charger around with me, but unfortunately, I am just too dunderheaded to remember an extra device. Trust me, I\u2019ve spent more than 30 years trying to become less forgetful, but the hassle of remembering to keep one more device charged, in addition to my phone, various other mobile devices (I own an Android tablet in addition to my iPad), and laptop is beyond my already beleaguered mental constraints. That\u2019s why I jumped (ha) at the chance to try  Native Union\u2019s JUMP Cable , a nifty cable/battery pack combo. The JUMP Cable, which  blew past its Kickstarter goal  in February, is now available to buy for $49.99. That is a bit\u00a0pricey because it only holds a 30 percent charge, but that 30 percent is enough power to buy you an additional hour or two on your phone at the end of the day when you really need it, even if you use power-draining apps. And since you can charge and sync your iPhone with the JUMP Cable instead of using its lightning cable (a micro-USB version is also available for other\u00a0devices), it\u2019s almost impossible to forget, even if you are woefully absentminded like me. I just unplug my phone and the cord, wrap it securely around the battery pack, and toss both in my bag. The battery pack and 19-inch cable weigh only 1.5oz together, so it doesn\u2019t add much bulk to the mass of stuff I carry around each day.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/31/this-labor-day-reflect-on-diversity-and-the-future/", "content": "2014 is the year that work became a central point of discussion in Silicon Valley. For the engineers and knowledge workers in the region, issues of diversity and inclusion finally got their turn in the limelight, forcing us to question our deeply-held views about the meritocracy of Silicon Valley. We also had to confront news that several of  our most iconic technology companies conspired to hold down wages for employees . While that legal case continues to wind its way through motions and procedures, the message remains crystal clear about how executives see their engineering talent. Our efforts have not just been internal though, but have also affected the way our entire economy runs. Airbnb, Uber, and other startups in the sharing economy have started to redefine work in the 21st century. That transformation has led to much controversy, such as when  Uber unilaterally lowered prices on its UberX service  or  TaskRabbit completely revamped its work bidding system . But it has also ushered in an opportunity for  startups to take the lead for workers rights in the coming years . There has certainly been obnoxiously bad behavior displayed by members of our community over the past year, but also deep glimmers of hope for a kinder and gentler Silicon Valley. As we enter into the final stretch of this Labor Day weekend, it\u2019s worth taking a break from grilling, driving, or, you know, Burning Man, and assess the status of work today in our innovation ecosystem. Where are we truly improving the quality of life for employees, and where are we harming our own efforts? Some of the most important contributions that Silicon Valley has made to better the lives of employees are so common now that they are often taken for granted. Notwithstanding the  simmering debate over the value of open workspaces , technology companies have encouraged all kinds of lifestyle improvements for employees, including both amenities and cultural improvements such as open communication, radical transparency, and flat management. It should be no surprise then that  Fortune\u2019s list of top 100 employers  included five technology companies in the top ten, and Glassdoor listed ten technology companies in  the top 20 of its Best Places to Work list . For engineers and other startup knowledge workers, we live in a time of plenty. Job offers can be found in a period of days in some cases, and salaries even for new college graduates are well above the national average. Unfortunately, not everyone has had the opportunity to take advantage of the surfeit of activity going on in technology these days. Issues of diversity and inclusion have become common points of discussion about the future of the tech workforce. When it comes to female rates of participation in the Valley, there remains an incredible gap between our notion of a true meritocracy and what the reality is for female engineers and other employees of tech companies. Our increased awareness has meant that more and more news stories have come out about the bad behavior of members of our community. The list is long,  from startup CEOs and their fraternity-era emails , to  venture capitalists who attempt to turn pitch sessions into romantic evenings . Yet despite such discussions, there remains a virulent group opposed to efforts to make our culture more inclusive, opposition that I honestly have never quite understood. Thankfully, women are starting to get the infrastructure to support their technology careers that they should have had years ago. While shaming is a useful and important tactic, ultimately it is our ability to foster the next generation of female engineers and entrepreneurs that will change our culture for the better. Boot camps like  Hackbright Academy are offering female-only programming lessons  that provide a pathway into the tech industry. Other boot camps like DevBootcamp are offering discounts for women and other underrepresented minorities in order to build a more representative workforce. These efforts complement programs by Google, Facebook, and other technology companies to actively promote inclusion through conferences and activities. Cultural change is never easy nor fast, but we each have a responsibility to ensure that every member of both sexes has the opportunity to put their skills forward for the betterment of our society. If Silicon Valley is truly leading the world of innovation, we will certainly build even more awesome products when we take advantage of all the talents we potentially have at our disposal. Coupled with the increased attention to women\u2019s issues has been the heightened understanding of the lack of diversity that plagues Silicon Valley\u2019s top technology companies.  Thanks to forthright and transparent diversity reports published by a number of companies , we now have real data that underrepresented minorities are only a tiny sliver of our workforce \u2014 particularly in engineering departments \u2014\u00a0despite representing about a quarter of the population in the United States. These workforce reports are vital for our understanding of diversity in employment, and frankly, they should be mandatory for any large employer. As product managers love to harp, data is the most crucial element for improving our products and services, and the first step in improving our diversity is simply to get a handle on what it looks like today. But even though these diversity statistics are important, such numbers belie the individuals who are the key to improving our engagement across gender, ethnic, and cultural lines. Each of us can find ways to give back to the next generation, whether its advising a code bootcamp or mentoring students in after-school activities. Heck,  13-year olds are writing apps for smartphones these days  \u2014 that mentee of yours may just be the next Facebook founder. As a personal anecdote, these sorts of one-on-one sessions are what cemented my interest in technology at a young age. When I was in middle school, I wanted to learn more about programming, but like many U.S. schools, there wasn\u2019t a class or a teacher who could teach me the subject. But my school reached out to the nearby high school, and they found a student who was willing to volunteer and tutor me starting with programming BASIC on TI graphing calculators. Everyone in our community has the power to make such a long-term impact on a student. Having recently returned from Asia, the thought that keeps coming up in my mind is how people outside California see Silicon Valley as a beacon on the hill, the pinnacle of innovation and the champion of our world\u2019s progress. The quotidian moments of a Bay Area engineer\u2019s existence, from getting on a private shuttle with Wi-Fi, to extensive meals filled with organic foods, to massage rooms and sleep pods, are completely alien to most of the rest of the world, and are talked about almost to the point of reverence. We have come far in improving the quality of our work and our lives. While we haven\u2019t always been as inclusive as we should be, that doesn\u2019t mean the future has to emulate the past. If ever there was a region that understood that, it\u2019s Silicon Valley.

Twitter VP of Engineering finally just  wrote a blog post about it  that Twitter PR points everyone to when they inquire about new experiments. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a day to go by when we\u2019re not releasing at least one experiment,\u201d he wrote. I\u2019ve written before about the way that Twitter was collating and interpreting the data from these ongoing experiments, but many of them have been centered around user growth or \u2018engagement\u2019 \u2014 getting people to interact with tweets and content. Even now, Twitter is conducting a host of experiments in dozens of \u2018buckets\u2019 of thousands of users. Recently, faves of  people who users follow began showing up  in feeds of activity \u2014 effectively curtailing the use of the fav as \u2018shorthand\u2019 and placing close to\u00a0par with the \u2018retweet\u2019. And Twitter has already experimented with injecting other content into your timeline, as  we reported recently . Not every \u2018fav\u2019 translates into a tweet being shoved into your timeline, instead an algorithm is used to determine the \u2018velocity and momentum of interest\u2019 in the tweet. If they\u2019re significant in your network, then Twitter will surface them for you, even if they would not normally have appeared in your feed. If this sounds familiar, then you may be thinking of the Magic Recs experiment, which  turned into a built-in feature  that sends you push notifications when a tweet, account or hashtag has gotten a lot of play in your network. But, we\u2019re told, the team behind the fav experiment is separate from Magic Recs \u2014 though both have the common thread of using an algorithm (an equation for interest, so to speak) to determine which tweets to surface. But we\u2019ve been informed by sources that Twitter isn\u2019t done experimenting\u00a0yet. In fact, a new effort internally will be touching many aspects of Twitter\u2019s consumer products \u2014 including the timeline. Specifically,\u00a0a more \u2018algorithmic\u2019 timeline that chooses things to share with you based on your interests and interactions and those of your network. Until recently, the Twitter timeline was an inviolate representation of who you chose to follow \u2014 and what they chose to share \u2014 in reverse chronological order. Then, ads and promoted tweets started getting more prominence, and the \u2018reply\u2019 mechanic started mucking around with the chronology of the timeline, bumping up old tweets when they were responded to. Now, Twitter is set to go further, with a more \u2018algorithmic\u2019 approach to users\u2019 timelines Personally, the first thing I check when I hit Twitter is not my main timeline or the Discover tab but my Notifications tab. This is where the \u2018life\u2019 on Twitter is for me. People replying to me, favs being thrown back and forth, people mentioning me when they think there\u2019s something I\u2019d be interested in. I\u2019d personally be just fine if the main timeline was melded more with things like this, as they make Twitter feel more engaging. I\u2019d be willing to bet that it\u2019s hard for most new Twitter users to get this kind of feeling and experience from the platform, especially with how difficult it has been for them to nail the on-boarding experience. Years after I first  wrote about the poor initial impression  Twitter gave to new users, the company just rolled out a new on-boarding process that improves on some things but still misses the mark in others. It still focuses, for instance, on lists of people who it feels you should follow, enforcing a minimum of follows if at all possible. \u201cForcing follows like this\u00a0seems like the wrong approach, since enjoying Twitter is about curating your timeline,\u201d says Owen Williams in a  recent piece about Twitter\u2019s new on-boarding method . I agree that forcing follows is a bad idea, but I don\u2019t think that forcing \u2018curation\u2019 right from the get go is wise either. Another solution would be to ask about interests and present users with an algorithmically driven timeline that allowed them to get up and running right away \u2014 curating their own follows and culling content they didn\u2019t like over time. Sources inside and outside the company\u00a0I\u2019ve spoken to emphasized to me repeatedly that the biggest challenge Twitter faces is how to show the \u2018good stuff\u2019 of Twitter to people who haven\u2019t built a decent timeline. As any long-time twitterer knows, the service is very much \u2018what you make of it\u2019 and poor choices in initial followers (or difficulty understanding how to make those choices) likely kill off many potential users before they get hooked. In the\u00a0on-boarding process, Twitter could use signals (who you picked to follow initially, who your friends are via contacts etc) to generate an automatic timeline of content that showed you stuff that wasn\u2019t completely dependent on your \u2018good taste\u2019 in follows. As one person put it to me, Twitter could see that you followed a particular player from, say, the Yankees \u2014 but not one who used Twitter particularly well \u2014\u00a0and it could show you other, more prolific or \u2018engaging\u2019 Yankees players in your timeline without you having to follow them or other people in your feed having to explicitly share them via retweets or favorites. The key, of course, is all about timeline relevancy. Twitter\u2019s power comes from the fact that it provides and up-to-the-second snapshot of the world shared over the web. Facebook\u2019s algorithm focuses on the most read (engaged) or most likely to be read content. Twitter\u2019s should \u2014 and I say this hopefully, not factually \u2014\u00a0focus on delivering content that\u2019s \u2018right\u2019 for the right user at the right time. That\u2019s both in content and, more importantly, temporally. Thresholds for how \u2018old\u2019 the packages of content we formerly called tweets can be before they\u2019re no longer \u2018relevant\u2019 will have to be tweaked and tuned carefully. Before you get up in arms about this kind of algorithmic content shifting your timeline around too much remember that retweets, one of the earliest additional functions of Twitter, already offer a mechanism for presenting older content as \u2018fresh\u2019 in your feed. The difference being that one is initiated by another human you\u2019ve chosen to follow and the other by a server in a room somewhere. If Twitter is able to honor the same kind of relevancy in older content that RT\u2019s do (humans believing they\u2019re still current) then its algorithmic timeline could actually make for a more compelling experience. Selfishly, as a Twitter \u2018power user\u2019 of sorts, I would love a toggle that gave me the \u2018plain Jane\u2019 timeline as it exists now \u2014 but that adds complexity so who knows. This new effort is said to be headed by Twitter\u2019s VP of Product Daniel Graf, a former Googler in the Maps department. I\u2019ve spoken to people inside and outside the company who have had both complimentary and doubtful things to say about Graf\u2019s new approach and his understanding of Twitter. But that\u2019s not out of the ordinary with any incoming product head. Graf was hired earlier this year to replace long-time chief Michael Sippey. A recent  Businessweek article from Sarah Frier and Brad Stone \u00a0reported that \u2018user interface\u2019 changes were in the works, driven by Graf. I\u2019m sure that some will react negatively to the concept of an algorithmic timeline \u2014 especially when you consider that the approach will likely be used to show you more \u2018promoted\u2019 content as well as organic content. But I think that it\u2019s an important step in making a Twitter that can attract and retain a billion or more users at some point in time. If you consider the \u2018 design for the 80% \u2019 philosophy that many companies apply to making a mass appeal product, then Twitter\u2019s current core concepts are in even more need of a rethinking. With billions of potential users out there and only ~280M of them on board so far \u2014 who do you design for? Recent events like Israel and Gaza, Ferguson and  even the World Cup  have demonstrated to me that there is a real, powerful benefit to a Twitter that can show media and text in conjunction with real-time reporting and news \u2014 and that is designed that way from the ground up. The challenge would be to not give up the unique qualities that made Twitter the place to be for those events, not Facebook \u2014 mostly the real-time and  seemingly \u2018unfiltered\u2019 nature of the service . Will I miss the simple, straightforward timeline? Sure. But am I convinced that this will \u2018ruin\u2019 Twitter? No. Could it? Absolutely. The timeline as a concept was so powerful, so concise, that it powered the first 7 years of Twitter without any real structural changes. That\u2019s extremely rare in a product, especially in today\u2019s pivot-happy startup environment. But it also makes it that much more difficult for Twitter to make large changes without upsetting core constituents. Selfishly, I don\u2019t want Twitter to change too much, and if it does I want it to emphasize personal conversations and content over something that\u2019s interesting to the rest of the world but not me. But it\u2019s an incredibly tough challenge and there are no easy answers to what\u2019s best for the \u2018next billion users\u2019. Twitter did not respond to inquiries about upcoming changes to its product.", "tags": "[\"Twitter\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/twitter-analytics.jpg?w=738", "title": "Twitter\u2019s Timeline Could Get (More) Algorithmic"},

But the  Yohann , designed by Swiss architect Berend Frenzel, ticks all of my boxes. First up, it\u2019s a thing of beauty, with an incredibly simple but clever \u2014 why didn\u2019t I think of that \u2014 design. It\u2019s also highly functional, in terms of viewing angles and positions. And it\u2019s European-made. Two versions are currently  being crowd funded on Kickstarter . One manufactured with a glassfiber-reinforcedpolymer body covered with a high-end \u201cpiano\u201d lacquer finish, and a second handcrafted wooden version, made in Germany and Italy, respectively. However, the most impressive thing is the way Frenzel has managed to take something so simple and make it so functional, allowing the one piece stand to house an iPad in three discrete viewing angles \u2014 from upright to a much more lean-back angle \u2014 in both landscape and portrait mode, as well as enabling it to be used resting on soft surfaces, such as your lap or bed. As Jonathan \u201cJony\u201d Ive  once said , \u201ctrue simplicity is derived from so much more than just the absences of clutter or ornamentation. It\u2019s about bringing order to complexity.\u201d And, dare I say it, the zen-like Yohann looks to have achieved this in spades and is a product the Apple design chief himself might well be proud of. With that said, the Yohann is (like many of Apple\u2019s own products) premium-priced. The glassfiber-reinforcedpolymer and lacquer-finished version is currently available at $69 for early Kickstarter backers (the cheapest option has already gone). And, likewise, the various wood versions start from $129. The former fit the iPad 2/3/4/Air, while the latter adds the iPad mini, too. That higher pricing is, in part, attributed to being manufactured locally, \u201cunder european working conditions and ecological standards and [in the case of the wood version] made from sustainably grown regional wood types.\u201d There\u2019s also a patent pending in the U.S. and China, presumably to fend off inevitable cheaper knock-offs.", "tags": "[\"iPad\", \"Europe\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/yohann_high-res_09.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/yohann_high-res_10.jpg?w=300&h=265 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/yohann_high-res_08.jpg?w=680&h=455", "title": "Yohann Is An iPad Stand Jony Ive Could Be Proud Of"},

The  company declined to comply . In a statement, Microsoft said that it \u201cwill not be turning over the email and plans to appeal.\u201d This\u00a0 protest act by Microsoft , arguing that domestic warrants should not be able to command access to data stored abroad, has  picked up support  from other technology companies. Profits are at risk. Modern technology companies vend cloud-based services to a global user base \u2014 if any one country can use domestic warrants to command\u00a0access to the data of all companies that are headquartered within its borders, regardless of where the information in question is physically stored, no company can protect the data of users who hail from other countries from its own government. That would harm the company\u2019s\u00a0ability to sell services to those potential international customers. More to the point, why a United States search warrant would apply to a datacenter in Ireland holding data of a person that may not be a United States citizen is somewhat suspect. The ability to segregate data away from the reach of the United States government matters all the more in the current technological climate, living as we are in the wake of the NSA revelations that showed the world precisely how far the reach of the country\u2019s surveillance powers actually are. If using the technology product of a United States-based firm leaves your data at the whim of the United States government, wouldn\u2019t you consider using a rival product from a firm that doesn\u2019t share the weakness? It would be nice to live in a world where companies could use geographical distance to protect the data not just from the United States government\u2019s hands, but from the hands of all governments.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/vandrico-wants-to-become-the-wearables-platform-for-the-wordplace/", "content": "If you know about Vandrico, it\u2019s probably because of the company\u2019s  cool wearables database  we featured  earlier this year . That was\u00a0 just a byproduct of Vandrico\u2019s research, however. What the company is really about is bringing wearables into the workplace. I first met Vandrico co-founders Kenna MacKenzie and Gonzalo Tudela at last year\u2019s  Grow conference in Vancouver . At that time, the two had a general idea of what they wanted to create, but they were still far from having a fully working product. I met up with the two again at Grow (this time  in Whistler ) and by now, Vandrico doesn\u2019t just have a working platform (dubbed \u201cCanary\u201d), but it has already signed deals with a number of large companies that are testing its products. As Tudela told me, the idea here is to create a very flexible platform that allows businesses to deploy wearables to their employees, no matter whether that business is a mining company, utility or a small business. For the most part right now, the platform is mostly about being able to send alerts to users. Because it\u2019s completely platform agnostic, a worker could be wearing a smartwatch, a head-mounted display like Google Glass or any other wearable. Here is how the team described how the service could work in a mining company: Say there is an emergency in a mine and the worker is using a smartwatch (probably something more rugged than an LG G watch). An alert would go right to the watch, but besides just showing a red \u201cemergency\u201d screen, the watch could then also show exactly what to do next \u2014 maybe in the form of a map that leads to the nearest safe spot or a checklist for managing the emergency. To show off how Vandrico works across platforms, the team showed me a demo that simultaneously sent an emergency alert to a smartwatch, Google Glass, a  Recon Jet  and, for good measure, a good old smartphone. Most companies will probably want to deploy Vandrico\u2019s Canary server behind their own firewalls to ensure that they can use the service internally even when their regular Internet connections are down.\u00a0Canary offers a REST API, so integrating it with existing services should be pretty straightforward. As Tudela tells me, there is a lot of excitement about wearables in the enterprise. Vandrico itself is working with the large Canadian communications company Telus, for example, to bring wearables to the workplace and one of Vandrico\u2019s latest integrations was\u00a0with Motion Metrics \u2014 a  monitoring solution  for the mining sector. Here is another example for how a mining company could use the service (Vandrico being a Canadian company, the energy sector is obviously high on its list of potential users): The enterprise is notoriously slow when it comes to adopting new technologies, but from what I\u2019ve seen and heard in the last few months, there are many\u00a0companies that are interested in at least starting some pilot projects because they see the some tangible benefits. \u00a0", "tags": "[\"smartwatch\", \"Enterprise\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/unnamed-42.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/unnamed-5.jpg?w=926&h=695", "title": "Vandrico Wants To Become The Wearables Platform For The Workplace"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/if-apple-makes-a-move-into-mobile-payments-it-could-not-come-at-a-better-time/", "content": "As Apple inches closer to its  news event on September 9 , there has been growing speculation that\u00a0mobile payments will be a part of the action.\u00a0Apple, the reports say, will add\u00a0 NFC technology \u00a0to the iPhone 6, and it will debut\u00a0a mobile wallet-style service that could include integrations with\u00a0 American Express ,  Visa and MasterCard \u00a0and possibly \u00a0PayPal \u00a0to enable physical, in-store payments using the smartphone. The reports of Apple finally making the mobile payments jump seem\u00a0to have  redoubled \u00a0this  year , boosted by positive payment comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook himself. If the reports are\u00a0accurate, a mobile payments service from Apple\u00a0would have\u00a0been a long time in the making, coming after \u00a0years \u00a0of speculation involving  potential acquisitions ;\u00a0lots of  patents ;\u00a0a steadily growing pile of consumer credit card data from its (likely over)  800 million iTunes accounts ;\u00a0and as a counterbalance to moves from  would-be competitors . It also could not come at a better time, considering how\u00a0many other mobile payments promises have fumbled or failed, so far, to live up to the promise. Carriers have failed to get the ball rolling fast enough.  Mobile operators used to be\u00a0seen as an\u00a0essential\u00a0lynchpin in how a mobile payments service could work. That was partly because of their position in the mobile ecosystem \u2014 holders of payment details, bank licenses, handset deals, and customer relationships. All this has combined to paint carriers as a likely source from which mobile payment services could flow. It it\u2019s partly because telcos are always on the hunt for more services to complement their stale bread and butter of voice and text revenues. Sure, there have been some successful services in some markets, like  Japan . But\u00a0independent and consortium-based efforts in countries like the U.S. (such as the  soon-to-rebrand Isis ) and Europe (such as the  many years-old   Weve \u00a0in the UK) have been slow to take off. Interestingly, from what we have heard, Apple may focus on point-of-sale technology initially rather than the wider applications of mobile payments that might involve services like carrier billing. But from what we understand this is also something that Apple is continuing to focus on as well. Startups that could have been mobile payment leaders appear to have lost their way.  For a while, it\u00a0looked like Square would be the standard bearer of the mobile payments space, riding into the market on the top of Apple\u2019s iPhone. There was a lot of hope and promise around Square\u2019s dongle-based system, a format replicated by  competitors near  and  further afield . Initially catering to small businesses\u00a0by letting them take card payments easily using smartphones and tablets, Square then started to look much more ambitious after a deal with and investment from cafe chain Starbucks, and then a number of other services subsequently developed around and beyond that basic offering. But something  didn\u2019t seem to click , it seems. Now, with a new funding round at a $6 billion valuation on the cards, it seems people are wondering if\u00a0the\u00a0margins on these services are\u00a0just too thin, if\u00a0growth has simply not come fast enough to make a decent return, and if Square\u2019s other lines of business are going to work out longer term. And while companies like Square and PayPal have made a lot of inroads with retailers, they are not the only ones. Apple, with its own successful chain of stores and resellers, has a lot of insight into how to build out a retail-based payments service that I suspect gives it a lot of credibility with businesses.\u00a0Apple\u2019s relationship with IBM could also potentially come into play here as well, especially in relation to integrating systems for larger retailers. NFC has long been an object of ridicule. \u00a0As Natasha once  pointed out , NFC \u2014 the acryonym for near-field communication, or the technology that allows a handset to effectively be transformed into your credit card at a point of sale \u2014 actually stands for \u201cNobody F****** Cares.\u201d But while the technology has long been a niche idea, it appears that we may finally be approaching some kind of critical mass: While there were only some 275 million NFC-equipped phones shipped in 2013, IHS researches  predict  that by 2018 that number will be 1.8 billion, representing penetration of 64%. \u00a0That kind of critical mass will see more services and acceptance come in its wake. For a company like Apple, what\u2019s interesting is not just the prospect of the company supporting and enabling NFC on the iPhone, but how Apple may choose to link this up with other new technology, from iBeacons for in-store alerts for shoppers, to fingerprint sensors for extra authentication, and its Passbook as a way of aggregating orders and storing receipts, linked up, of course, with Apple\u2019s existing billing information by way of iTunes. Given that so much of this has been put in place already over the the years, the\u00a0prospect is for a fully-developed product right at launch. (That is, fully developed if\u00a0Apple\u00a0captures users\u2019\u00a0trust for a new, cloud-based service \u2014 something that could potentially get called into question in light of scenarios like the  iCloud/celebrity photo \u00a0hack.) Like it did with the iPhone amidst a range of other existing smartphones, Apple will not the first mover in mobile payments. Just the one that brings everything together the best.", "tags": "[\"iPhone 6\", \"Apple\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/img_9900.jpg?w=738", "title": "If Apple Makes A Move Into Mobile Payments, It Could Not Come At A Better Time"},

The  Press Fit standing desk  began life as a Kickstarter project designed to fix both those problems, with an innovative standing desk design that\u2019s easy to assemble/break down and reassemble, and that won\u2019t break the budget. Press Fit is a new furniture company out of Boston founded by MIT graduate students David Yamnitsky and Isabella Trombo, which aims to create affordable furnishings that are built out of solid, sustainable materials, which can be manufactured in the U.S. and which can be assembled, taken apart and moved around easily by just a single individual. The company\u2019s first piece of furniture, the Press Fit Standing Desk initially sought $10,000 on Kickstarter to fund its first production run, and managed to raise just under $65,000. Now that the project has come to a close, Yamnitsky and Trombo are bringing the  standing desk to consumers via self-run pre-orders  so that those who missed the chance to get in on the action during the campaign can order one now. Yamnitsky sent over one of the first production prototypes off of the line so that I could check it out in action, and it\u2019s impressive out of the box. Assembly, even on my own, took about 5 minutes, and most of that time was spent removing bubble wrap from the individual pieces. There\u2019s no hardware, nails or screws to deal with, and yet the desk feels solid and doesn\u2019t exhibit any noticeable shake when you\u2019re typing away on your laptop while standing. Plus it breaks apart in less than a minute for easy transportation to another room or a new location. The Press Fit has impressive fit and finish, too, even if the industrial design isn\u2019t going to blow anyone away in terms of style. Also, I learned quickly to remember not to move the desk just by picking it up by its top surface, as it\u2019ll just come off of the base. For just $200, Press Fit\u2019s option is a durable, convenient option that is amazing simply because of its easy assembly.

Last summer\u2019s  Sensoria smart socks \u00a0blasted off crowdfunding blocks with a similar idea, although runScribe involves a bit less faff, given it consists of just the one wearable device that clips to your shoe, rather than a pair of socks and an ankle clip. (Super serious runners can opt to use one\u00a0RunScribes\u00a0per foot per run but that level of detail is\u00a0not required\u00a0to power its\u00a0gait analysis). What exactly does runScribe measure? A full 13 kinematic metrics (with its Pro pack) captured via the 9-axis sensor within the device, including\u00a0stride length, pronation, contact time, swing excursion and stance excursion.\u00a0It uses these metrics to create a runScore so the user\u00a0can easily compare one run with another, i.e. without having to drill down into all the individual metrics every time \u2014 although that remains entirely possible with the full service. And desirable if you are, for instance, trying out a new pair of kicks to decide whether they are appropriate for your running style. Figuring out which shoes best suit your running style can be a tricky problem, which is why some dedicated running stores offer an in-house gait analysis service where staff watch you run on a treadmill and suggest shoes that might be suitable.\u00a0The problem there is these\u00a0staff aren\u2019t impartial, given they are trying to sell you the shoes in their shop. RunScribe aims\u00a0to provide enough granular data to allow the runner to determine which shoes suit them best \u2014 and do that by collectively analyzing the running data of scores of users. If its\u00a0makers can get\u00a0their wearable\u00a0onto the shoes of enough runners they can\u00a0start\u00a0building the\u00a0big data cache they need to\u00a0power\u00a0that\u00a0expertise\u00a0and pull a\u00a0community of runners into orbit around pack-leading\u00a0gait specialism. That\u2019s the vision. For now runScribe is still a prototype. So far\u00a0they\u2019ve\u00a0more than tripled their original $50,000 Kickstarter funding target,\u00a0and still have 17 days of their campaign to run. (No pun intended.) \u00a0The crowdfunding route offers a chance for this specialized wearable maker\u00a0to drive enough early users to hit a\u00a0critical mass of data quicker. To hit the ground running, you could say. The runScribe wearable starts at $99 to Kickstarter backers with access to limited metrics, or from $139 with full access to metrics. It\u2019s not yet clear whether the metrics service will end up requiring\u00a0a\u00a0subscription. Kickstarter backers get one year free access guaranteed. After that the device\u2019s makers\u00a0say it\u2019s tbc whether there will be a recurring\u00a0charge to use the service, or whether they will offer\u00a0a freemium model \u2014 likely gating the really granular gait analysis behind a fee. The runScribe wearable\u00a0itself is scheduled to be shipped to backers by this December.", "tags": "[\"running\", \"Wearables\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-01-at-8-31-24-pm.png?w=620 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-01-at-8-44-48-pm.png?w=620&h=422", "title": "RunScribe Is A Wearable For Granular Gait Analysis"},

Despite that fact, a large chunk\u00a0of the global PC market still runs the operating system.\u00a0And with more than 20 percent share, Windows XP\u2019s piece of the global PC pie isn\u2019t declining very quickly. According to  Net Applications , Windows XP\u2019s global desktop market share fell from 24.82 percent in July, to 23.89 percent in August. That\u2019s just under one percentage point in a full month. At that pace, it will take more than two years for Windows XP\u2019s market share to fully dissipate. Windows 7\u2019s market share has been essentially flat during\u00a0the summer. The now-dated operating system benefits from corporate customers who want to get off of XP, but are not sold on Windows 8. (Those corporate sales, it\u2019s worth noting, have helped players in the PC market turn in stronger\u00a0earnings.) But it appears that the larger Windows XP userbase will take an age to unwind. In March, for example, Windows XP had\u00a029.53 percent global PC market share. There are numerous\u00a0 security risks \u00a0for those who remain on Windows XP. However, less  than 10 percent of corporate PCs are still run\u00a0Windows XP . That fact implies that a large chunk of the remaining Windows XP-running computers in the market\u00a0are in the hands of consumers. Consumer PC demand has been weak in recent quarters, perhaps causing at least in part the slow deflation of XP. This puts the Windows world into an interesting place: If the  rapidly approaching Windows 9  can induce consumer excitement of any sort, it could help get regular folks off of Windows XP and onto a far more secure operating system. Add that little tidbit to the cadre of reasons why Windows 9 is a very critical release for the software company.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/guiabolso-brings-mint-style-financial-management-to-brazil/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:   Julie Ruvolo is a  freelance writer  and editor of  RedLightR.io  and  RioChromatic.com . In August a new, homegrown entry raced onto Brazil\u2019s top 10 most downloaded apps. It\u2019s a list usually cluttered by American-made social media, music and gaming apps; but  GuiaBolso , a Mint-style personal finance app joined the App Store on July 2 when Brazil was midway through a month-long World Cup paralysis and passed Tinder, Facebook and even WhatsApp over the last month to reach the No. 5 most downloaded app in Brazil, with no official launch announcement or marketing budget. The novelty of one app to rule all of your bank and credit card accounts, and Mint\u2019s ensuing acquisition by Intel in 2009, is already ancient digital history in the U.S. But despite  over a billion dollars  of investment in personal finance companies, GuiaBolso, a startup co-founded by  Benjamin Gleason , former managing director of Groupon Brazil and CFO of Groupon Latin America, and Thiago Alvarez, a long-time McKinsey alum working with the Brazilian banking industry, is the first company to enter the Brazilian market. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones in Brazil,\u201d Gleason told me on a call from S\u00e3o Paulo, where GuiaBolso is headquartered. \u201cPeople have been saying, \u201cWe finally have Mint in Brazil. Why didn\u2019t this come sooner?\u201d\u00a0Gleason says everyone he and Alvarez talked to, including a number of companies doing personal financial aggregation internationally, thought it would be impossible in Brazil. \u201cThe challenge was building the technology,\u201d says Gleason. \u201cEveryone thinks the banks are giving us their APIs but that\u2019s not the way it works.\u201d Yodlee , founded in 1999, was the first company to figure out the data integration necessary to launch a financial tracking service, Gleason says They currently power  over 500  financial apps, including white-hot  LearnVest , a personal finance management startup founded by 30-year-old  Alexa Von Tobel  that has raised $69 million in venture capital.\u00a0\u201cThe other part is that people were afraid of what the reaction of the Brazilian banks would be, and didn\u2019t want to take that risk,\u201d Gleason says. \u201cSo we knew the institutional side would be important.\u201d Gleason and Alvarez are well-prepared to navigate the political waters of disrupting the financial industry. In addition to their banking industry contacts from stints at Groupon and McKinsey, they have the support of experts like Neil Daswani, a former early Yodlee employee, web application security expert and professor at Stanford, and Gabriel Jaramillo, a founding partner at  Valor Capital  and former president of Brazil\u2019s Santander Bank. Valor participated in GuiaBolso\u2019s $1M seed round in March of 2013, along with Brazilian  e.Bricks  and six angel investors. Valor and e.Bricks returned for a $3 million Series A this May, led by Kaszek Ventures, and Kaszek Ventures\u2019 co-founder  Nicolas Szekasy  joined the board with e.Bricks\u2019  Pedro Melzer . Brazil\u2019s decade-long economic boom has lifted some 50 million Brazilians out of poverty and into the working class, but has had some unintended consequences. Even as Brazil\u2019s Central Bank reported that household income has doubled and unemployment has fallen by half, \u00a0has meant more purchases, more consumer debt, and ironically, higher prices. \u201cWages started rising, unemployment fell and there was a big boom in terms of access to credit cards and car loans, but the consumer-led demand was unsustainable,\u201d Gleason explains. \u201cDefault rates started spiking, and with 10-12% interest on credit cards in Brazil, once you get into a hole you can\u2019t get out. So you had this whole drive leading people to not controlling their finances or being able to pay back their loans.\u201d At the same time, Brazilians were coming online in droves \u2013  100 million  people, or half of Brazil\u2019s population,  came online in the last decade  \u2013 and started taking out their credit cards. \u201cCollective buying was a driver, because the ticket price of items on sites like Groupon was lower than big ticket items like TVs and fridges, and it seemed like you were getting a good deal, so literally millions of people joined the ecommerce wave, and that was really the start of it,\u201d Gleason says. \u201cI joined Groupon Brazil right at the beginning and caught the huge boom of the collective buying craze. We went from zero to 700 employees in a few months. It was out of control \u2013 we were just trying to keep the wheels from falling off.\u201d But after Groupon\u2019s IPO in 2011, the startup party turned corporate, and Gleason decided it was finally time to start something from scratch, after years of exchanging ideas with Alvarez since they met at McKinsey in 2007. \u201cTwo things that came out of that experience,\u201d Gleason says. \u201cIn Brazil, interest rates don\u2019t really mean much to people. They are only thinking about the installment they have to pay.\u00a0 The other thing is that people don\u2019t consider themselves in debt if all their payments are current. So if they have a car loan and credit card balance and are paying it every month, they say they don\u2019t have debt, until they start to default.\u201d \u201cAt the same time, Thiago was seeing these extremely lucrative banks with all kinds of money and doing nothing to innovate, while on the other hand you have Brazilian consumers, very low levels of financial education, who really don\u2019t understand the basic banking products being pushed at them,\u201d says Gleason. According to 2014 research by Brazil\u2019s National Confederation of Shopkeepers,  82%  of Brazilians say they don\u2019t know how to control their finances. \u201cIt became clear that there\u2019s a huge knowledge gap, and the Brazilian banks are not interested in creating new tools for consumers to narrow it.\u201d GuiaBolso began\u00a0as a humble operation out of Gleason\u2019s house in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2012. \u201cWe intentionally started out by bootstrapping to manage dilution and know exactly what product we wanted to go forward with,\u201d says Gleason. \u201cWe embraced all the lean startup stuff. We threw up a landing page and started to see what people were searching for. And one of the first things we found is that most people who were looking for financial guidance online were from the emerging \u201cC\u201d class, and most of their problems had to do with debt or not being able to balance their budget.\u201d (Media reports often cite that millions of Brazilians were lifted into the middle class, but it\u2019s a misnomer \u2013 Brazil\u2019s \u201cC\u201d class, on a scale of A through E, is what Americans would consider working class, making about $1,500-$2,500 household income per month.) GuiaBolso\u2019s first product, launched with their seed round funding in May of 2013, after a year of testing and 4,000 financial consultations in person and via the website, was an online financial consultant that solicited a few data points about the visitor\u2019s financial situation and offered customized and specific advice. But the experience was designed as a one-off tool and required manually inputting your information. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t going to be effective over time, so we looked at other markets in the personal finances management space. Mint dominated but all the offshoots went for different niches, like LearnVest [a platform originally designed for young professional women]. They were all using integration with bank accounts to generate tools and recommendations, and in Brazil there has never been account aggregation where you can see all your accounts together in one place, so we shifted our focus to that.\u201d Gleason and Alvarez started off looking for bridge financing, but Gleason says the American venture funds wanted to write bigger checks. They ended up closing a Series A after all, led by Buenos Aires-based Kaszek Ventures, which backed the Latin American success MercadoLibre. GuiaBolso launched their automated product in April of this year, which organizes three months of historical from Brazilian banks Itau, Bradesco, Santander and Banco do Brasil, representing about 80% of the retail banking market ,  into pie charts and primary colors of spending breakdowns versus goals set. \u201cBrazil is different than the U.S.,\u201d Gleason says. \u201cEverything is usually concentrated in one bank, credit cards are issued via the bank, and all of their investments and debt are with the same bank.\u201d Gleason says next priorities are to connect to the Caixa Economica (Brazil\u2019s Federal Savings Bank), Citi and HSBC. \u201cThen there are a few independent credit card companies \u2013 Amex, and store-issued credit cards like Casas Bahia.\u201d While GuiaBolso\u2019s first version catered to Brazilians in the working \u201cC\u201d class, the automated product is seeing primary adoption from Brazil\u2019s \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d classes, for obvious reasons: wealthier Brazilians are more likely to have a bank account and use online banking, have a higher percentage of electronic versus cash transactions, and are more likely to have an iPhone on which they can download the GuiaBolso app. Gleason sees that changing as internet access and smartphone penetration keep expanding to Brazil\u2019s lower income classes. \u201cOur target market is the 50 million checking accounts in Brazil that are eligible for internet banking,\u201d Gleason says, \u201cand they\u2019re projected to grow 40% by 2017, according to 2012 data from  CIAB FEBRABAN .\u201d \u201cBut across all levels of income, people have no clue how to manage their finances,\u201d Gleason says. According to a sample of 6,000 GuiaBolso users, about one-third of all expenses are credit card purchases paid for in installments, regardless of the user\u2019s income level. But while that represents only 4% of monthly income for users making over $5,000 a month, it\u2019s 10% of monthly income for users in the lowest income bracket.\u00a0 \u201cPeople making less income are the biggest hostages to installment payments. We were shocked.\u201d It\u2019s representative of bigger, troubling patterns in Brazil\u2019s economy. Since 2008, consumer loans have  more than doubled to around $600 billion , and household consumer debt has almost doubled to  25.6%  of Brazil\u2019s GDP. In 2013, Brazilians spent  $233 billion  on short-term interest payments, representing two months of their annual income. \u201cThat compares to about 10% in the US,\u201d Gleason says, \u201cBut it\u2019s worse: half of the debt in the US is in mortgages, while in Brazil it\u2019s mostly short-term debt.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s an opportune moment to launch free financial planning tools that make it really easy to break down and manage your monthly income and expenses. \u201cOur web product was growing 30% month over month with very little spending on paid marketing,\u201d Gleason says, \u201cand we were pretty happy with that, but our plans changed dramatically after launching the iPhone app in July. We\u2019ve already hit our growth targets for the year and have surpassed $1 billion worth of user financial transactions organized on our platform.\u201d At this rate, GuiaBolso may have the opportunity to figure out the big question Mint got to bypass after it was acquired by Intuit: How to make money. \u201cIt\u2019s a free app, and our focus is to keep growing and see where we can help people,\u201d says Gleason, \u201cso revenue is not on the dashboard for now. But if we can keep engagement high and acquire users cheaply, we can do a lot of experimentation with the LearnVest model for advising and long term planning, as well as offer our users products that are suited for them. But I don\u2019t want to send 100,000 people a credit card offer or serve them any banner ads.\u201d Image by Flickr user   Victor Camilo", "tags": "[\"MercadoLibre\", \"brazil\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/7701117582_dc04e7ea7b_k1.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/kaszek_ventures.jpeg?w=680&h=453 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/guia_founders.jpeg?w=680&h=453 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/startupmansion-coworking.jpg?w=680&h=453", "title": "GuiaBolso Brings Mint-style Financial Management To Brazil"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/tables-tablets-and-data/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note: \u00a0 Vladimir Edelman is the chief development officer of  NTN Buzztime , a bar and restaurant social entertainment and integrated marketing platform. Restaurants as we know them have remained the same for over 200\u00a0years, and fables about amazing restaurant tech have inevitably leapt to futuristic ideas: robot waiters, food printers, talking refrigerators. Today\u2019s reality is far more interesting and complex than those sweeping visions. A tsunami of technology, both from established industry providers such as POS and IT companies, as well as nimble startups such as  olo  and  NoWait , are changing the way the hospitality industry functions and what consumers will grow to expect. This new tech creates the \u201cDorothy Effect\u201d: We are all at once enthralled by the \u201cmagic\u201d we now experience on a daily basis, while also being forced to face and fight the lions and tigers and \u201cbugs\u201d that come with it. The role of the restaurateur now involves embracing technology while making sure customers don\u2019t feel like they are overwhelmed or inconvenienced. It\u2019s honestly a very tough job \u2013 but here are some insights I have gleaned from my years in the business. Small and medium businesses  are increasingly relying on data  to better understand their customers. Innovation in data analytics and business intelligence enable businesses to collect more information than ever before about their customers\u2019 preferences and values. But the trick is not in the collecting data \u2013 it\u2019s in how you use it. Take Pizza Hut, for example. In 2013, the international franchise  enjoyed a 12x return on ROI \u00a0thanks to its partnership with customer analytics company \u00a0Capillary Technologies . Capillary helped capture, structure and leverage large quantities of customer data, but more importantly, they helped Pizza Hut take its\u00a0massive customer base and segment it based on expressed characteristics, purchase tendencies and behavioral indicators to better engage each consumer. By implementing data analytics into their everyday marketing endeavors, Pizza Hut has created 6,000+ customer behavioral groups, empowering the brand to predict future purchases and execute campaigns at preferred times via customers\u2019 preferred engagement channels (direct mail, email, text message and more). Investing in such analysis has shown widespread sales growth across its restaurants and delivery business. Pizza Hut has seen a  38 percent improvement  in its customer retention rate. Customers respond well when their favorite eateries take the time to understand their likes and dislikes. And if you\u2019re not in a position to work with an analytics firm or technology provider that\u00a0includes data analysis as part of their product, there are alternatives. Whether investing in tabletop tablets, ordering kiosks, mobile  apps  for food ordering, reservations, or waitlist management, or any of the other myriad solutions \u2013 always\u00a0ask vendors to supply the data generated by customers. There are plenty of online tools you can feed that data into, such \u00a0MixPanel  or  Google Analytics , as these tools provide similar insight into your guests\u2019 dining habits and desires. If you want to stay ahead of the curve, it\u2019s time to start exploring your options and turn thoughts of \u201cbig bad data\u201d into \u201cbig beautiful data\u201d that can help boost your sales. Americans spend thousands of dollars a year eating out: Restaurants account for one of the largest parts of discretionary spending, with  sales expected to hit a record $683.4 billion in 2014.  It is a fiercely competitive industry, and yet restaurant owners and managers have been remarkably slow to adopt new forms of technology that could make their business more efficient and attuned to the desires of diners.\u00a0They spend a lot of time fighting trends instead of exploiting them. Take mobile devices, for example. Every day there is a new story about how people use phones or tablets at restaurants \u2013 whether to play games, text with friends or document a meal. Many restaurants bemoan the days of the somber, quiet meal, wringing their hands about how to engage these consumers, or at very least how to get their patrons to put their devices down. These devices aren\u2019t going away \u2013 not if Apple or Google have anything to say about it, anyways. Since your customers are already tapping away on their smartphones, tablets and computers, why not make these technologies an integral part of each patron\u2019s dining experience, and learn a thing or two? Major food chains have already recognized this potential, with tablets that allow customers to order food, customize their entertainment, and even pay the bill. By implementing this technology, restaurants can use this established behavior in their interactive environment, complete with brand messaging. For example, Buffalo Wild Wings is bringing Buzztime\u2019s BEOND tablet-based entertainment platform to all of their North America restaurant locations by the end of 2015. The BEOND tablets let Buffalo Wild Wings Guests order food, request songs and television programming, play games (both multi-player and arcade-style), and, pay the bill. Initial research has shown customers arestaying 75 minutes, compared to the industry average of 50 minutes, and they\u2019re returning at least twice a month compared to other restaurants where guests may visit once a month or less. Other national chains that have embraced tabletop tech have seen similar success. In the past year,  Chili\u2019s Grill and Bar  installed 7-inch Android  Ziosk  tablets at all of their locations; the devices,allow patrons to interactively peruse menu items, order beverages and desserts, play games together, share real-time feedback with the brand, and pay the check at the table. In a six-month trial period, Chili\u2019s saw an increase in per-person spend per check, translating to higher income for both the restaurant and wait staff. Servers also reported seeing more tips, as the system increases the spending on their shift. These results show that tabletop technology can be beneficial to servers, not a replacement for them. Additionally, these types of tablets can make it very easy for people to join loyalty clubs: \u201cWe saw improvements in guest satisfaction and engagement from many different touch points within the restaurant, including Chili\u2019s guest feedback surveys and Email Club,\u201d said Wyman Roberts, CEO and president of Brinker International and president of Chili\u2019s Grill & Bar. Applebee\u2019s  has also rolled out 100,000+  E la Carte  Presto tablets in its U.S. restaurants, with emphasis on ease of payments. Customers can use the tablets to view menu items, browse and add items to a cart, (a la online shopping), play some games, and pay the bill. Applebee\u2019s has seen similar positive results, as  TechCrunch reported  in 2013: \u201c(In) a two-year pilot program where Applebee\u2019s tested the tablets across 30 restaurants around the U.S. During these trials, the company found that having tablets available tableside allowed them to reduce the overall table turn time and transaction time for their guests, and guests who were surveyed about the tablets reported a better overall experience.\u201d While tabletop tablets are the latest innovation, the customer\u2019s own phone remains an incredibly powerful tool. Countless companies can help restaurants harness social activity, monitor online reviews, create lightweight loyalty programs, help customers check out, and even create in-store games (through augmented reality) to make sure that the restaurant becomes part of their mobile experience \u2013 and not just a place to fire up a phone and read some blogs. Restaurants have been reluctant to jump on the tech-driven dining experience for a number of reasons. Maybe tablet tech isn\u2019t suitable for a fine dining atmosphere, or the futuristic feel clashes with a retro-themed aesthetic. However, the opportunities to implement technology extend beyond consumer-facing, front-of-house operations. They can also streamline food buying, order taking, and even cooking. \u201cMany brands and operators are thinking even further outside the box, adding innovative technologies in the kitchen and at the front counter,\u201d QSR\u2019s Keith Loria explained in his article \u2018 Beyond the Tablet .  Panera , having invested in kitchen technology with color-coded screens that deliver orders to the kitchen staff, is one example of such outside the box thinking: A red stripe over an ingredient means leave it off, a green stripe indicates an addition. Other colors signify takeout. Similarly, in an attempt to keep its kitchen staff from having to memorize recipes and food preparation policies, Tex-Mex style fast food chain  Taco Bueno added tablets managed by mobile device management company AirWatch  to push recipes to its line cooks. Put simply, if your staff is happy, customers will (usually) be happy too. Kitchen technology like Panera\u2019s and Taco Bueno\u2019s can help cut down on stress and provide happy meals all around. Companies worried about technology pushing humans out of jobs and making employees more stressed out should instead educate their staff about how it is making their jobs easier, letting them focus on being the heart of the dining experience \u00a0\u2013 not just a set of arms and legs rushing from table to table. As the   New York Times \u2019 Stephanie Strom  put it, \u201cRestaurants have been late to the tech party, and many are now scrambling to incorporate tablets, apps, computerized kitchen equipment and data analysis capabilities.\u201d When proper strategy and implementation applied, technology solves problems that are fundamental to how restaurants operate and compete. And late is a lot better than never. A whopping  51 percent of restaurant operators said they will devote more resources to technology this year alone . As this trend continues to gain momentum, technology will become increasingly critical for any restaurant\u2019s success. At the rate we\u2019re going, tables and tablets will soon share more than a common etymology \u2013 both derived from the Latin \u201ctabula,\u201d meaning plank, tablet, list. One will be incomplete without the other, with technology inextricably linked and indispensable to the casual-dining experience. It may be only a matter of time before your tablet  is  your table (check out this  video  of Pizza Hut again pioneering the modern dining experience). While this may seem like a dream scene from a movie, this type of tech is very real and holds great potential for both businesses and customers in streamlining the dining experience and making it more fun. Now is the time for bar and restaurant owners and managers to research and try new technologies, and make the most of the vast trove of data that falls into their laps every day.", "tags": "[\"tablets\", \"Restaurants\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/shutterstock_93996670.jpg?w=738", "title": "Tables, Tablets, Data And Eating"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/when-does-uber-become-cheaper-than-owning-a-car/", "content": "Thanks to the proliferation of local transportation services like Uber, we\u2019re entering a world in which people have less reason to drive everywhere they need to go. But at what point will it become less expensive to rely on someone else to drive you around rather than driving yourself? In a  Medium post , HomeHero founder  Kyle Hill  does the math to find out, so that you don\u2019t have to.  As with any broad economic model, there are a number of external factors that could influence it. The overall cost of owning a vehicle will be determined by its gas mileage, the cost of gas in any given market, the length of one\u2019s commute, and (if applicable) the cost of parking in a major city. As a result, if goes without saying that results may vary significantly. Hill says he did the calculations after selling his own car \u2014 in Los Angeles of all places \u2014 and switching to mostly commuting by bike. His model is based on the average fare structure of Uber in that city, versus the average cost of owning, maintaining, and regularly filling up the gas tank of a car in the U.S. You should read the post yourself, but the basic gist is that the average cost of owning and driving a mid-sized sedan in the US is $8,876. Economy cars cost less, and SUVs cost more, which is no big surprise.  Hill also adds in the estimated cost of annual traffic and parking tickets, the cost of parking, and the so-called \u201copportunity cost\u201d of driving versus taking a mode of transportation in which you can answer emails or otherwise \u201cget stuff done.\u201d By doing so, he arrives at at annual cost of car ownership at $12,744 per year. Hill then compares that cost with how much Americans would spend on Uber given the average number of trips or amount of time they spend in their cars each year, based on some U.S. Census Bureau estimates. By taking the number of rides and multiplying by the cost of UberX in Los Angeles, he comes up with the total costs of $18,115 per year if a user decided to use Uber exclusively to get around everywhere. Again, caveats: He\u2019s using the base fare and mileage cost for Los Angeles, but fares vary widely by market. Furthermore, there are plenty of places where commuters either don\u2019t have to pay for parking at their home or workplace, and the cost of gas will vary widely based on seasonality and the location of the user. And, perhaps, most importantly \u2014 the model doesn\u2019t take into account the effect of surge pricing, which rears its head mostly during peak commuting hours in most markets. Regardless, he tries to figure out what the crossover point is for when Uber becomes cheaper than owning and driving a car. For the average Uber passenger paying L.A. fares, that crossover point would happen at 9,481 miles a year \u2014 which, to be honest, isn\u2019t a ridiculously low mileage for someone to amass in that period of time. This isn\u2019t the first time someone has sought to figure out the cost of Ubering versus owning a car. In fact, Uber data scientist Bradley Voytek did just that in  his own post on the topic  more than a year ago.  It\u2019s worth pointing out, however, that a lot has changed since then \u2014 driven by competition with Lyft and other services, the cost of UberX fares has dropped dramatically since then, making the cost of getting around even more affordable. And the introduction of services like UberPool are set to make getting around that much cheaper.  Anyway, while we aren\u2019t quite there yet, we\u2019re certainly much closer to living in a world where it might be the same price or even cheaper to rely on a mobile app to get from place to place than to drive everywhere. And that\u2019s a good thing, right?", "tags": "[\"Uber\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ber0434.jpeg?w=738", "title": "When Does Uber Become Cheaper Than Owning A Car?"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/linkedin-is-quietly-retiring-network-visualization-tool-inmaps/", "content": "A little autumn cleaning underway at\u00a0 LinkedIn . The company is quietly retiring InMaps, a tool that let you map out how your LinkedIn network looks. A notice on the  InMaps homepage  notes that today, September 1, is the last day for you to use it, and that it is being discontinued so that LinkedIn \u201ccan focus on developing new ways to visualize your professional network.\u201d As of right now, if you want it, you can still download and save your own\u00a0map for posterity. A slightly longer note in LinkedIn\u2019s help pages explains a bit more: Sometimes we have to retire tools we love so we can focus our attention and resources on creating even better experiences for our members. We\u2019re currently looking at new ways to help you visualize and gain insights from your professional network. That\u2019s why we\u2019re discontinuing InMaps as of September 1, 2014. A little background on InMaps: the\u00a0service was first launched in  January, 2011 \u00a0as a way for you to look at different clusters in your network, color code them, and see where they may cross over with each other, with separations happening often around current and previous jobs, education, social circles and so on. Through this you could also interact, by clicking on hubs to see different profiles. InMaps\u00a0was\u00a0built by Ali Imam, once a transplant from Yahoo Analytics who eventually became a LinkedIn principal data scientist at for a short stint. Three months short, to be exact: by\u00a0July of this year, Imam\u00a0 had left LinkedIn for Cloudera . (He\u2019s not the only person on the data science side departing\u00a0LinkedIn of late\u00a0\u2014 Deep Nishar, SVP of Product, is  also leaving the company .) It\u2019s not clear how popular\u00a0InMaps as a product has been (LinkedIn Labs,  it seems , has not). But\u00a0generally, LinkedIn, now with 313 million users, has been making other moves to rethink how users of its platform interact with the data contained on it. While companies like  Google  and  Yahoo  have\u00a0been known for sometimes sweeping spring cleans, LinkedIn\u2019s garden, perhaps less overgrown, has needed\u00a0a lot less pruning. For LinkedIn, the name of the game right now seems to be more focus on its platform and core experience \u2014 or at least trying to steer into\u00a0what exactly that core experience could or\u00a0should be. That has included, for better or worse, more restricted access\u00a0of\u00a0the company\u2019s API,\u00a0 cutting off some CRM apps  that violate its  API terms of service ;\u00a0and  changes to products like Rapportive  to limit the amount of third-party, non-LinkedIn information that can be viewed via the email widget. At the same time, it seems like the kinds of analytics and additional insight that LinkedIn offers to you as a user is coming by way of features more directly integrated into your profile rather than features that take you away from LinkedIn\u2019s main platform and apps. One example: the  enhanced ability to see how you rank against your peers  at the same time that you check in on who has been  lurking around \u00a0looking at your profile page. And, now that LinkedIn is also  looking to grow its\u00a0B2B marketing services business into a billion dollar operation , it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see new analytics features get released\u00a0to fill out that business as well.", "tags": "[\"LinkedIn\", \"Enterprise\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-02-at-02-02-14.png?w=704", "title": "LinkedIn Is Quietly Retiring Network Visualization Tool InMaps"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/there-are-only-two-weeks-left-to-comment-on-net-neutrality/", "content": "\n With less than two weeks\u00a0before the FCC closes\u00a0 comments  on  proceeding #14-28 , also known as the landmark Net Neutrality issue, viral video firm  Thinkmodo  is releasing a new video in one last attempt to get the word out and get those comments forms filling again. You may recognize some of the company\u2019s previous videos. Indeed, it\u2019s strong work and I\u2019ve covered it before\u2026like the\u00a0 Carrie video  or the  Chronicle video  or the iPad Head Girl video. This video, in particular, is a call to arms regarding the issue of  Net Neutrality  and it cleverly gets the idea across that we shouldn\u2019t \u201cflush\u201d our freedoms away (you\u2019ll get why after you watch.) I agree with their message and I think it\u2019s something all of us digital consumers should be concerned about. Take heed. Make no mistake though, this is also paid work\u00a0for one of their clients \u2014 Internet provider Namecheap.com \u2014 so in one way, it\u2019s kind of an ad. Believe me, I am aware of the contradiction\u00a0that merely covering an advertisement indirectly helps advertise it. But this issue is worthy of any buzz it can get, ad or no ad, so I\u2019m willing to take that chance. However, as a provider, NameCheap has as much to risk as any company out there for whom Internet speed is a factor. Since\u00a0they are not the biggest kid on the block, I can see why they might commission this work and use it to help\u00a0 lead their own crusade  against the tiered access model. The video calls for users to visit  netneutrality.com \u00a0(which they own) \u00a0in order to get info about how to send comments through the site. To recap what Net Neutrality actually is, I urge you to look no further than  former Crunchies host John Oliver\u2019s succinct rant and primer on the subject . However, if you don\u2019t have thirteen minutes to spend getting up to speed by watching that video or reading the Wikipedia link up above, let me sum it up: Without Net Neutrality (or The Open Internet as the FCC puts it), certain network providing companies will be able to create a tiered system of internet speeds, meaning that digital companies with deeper pockets can purchase more and faster throughput for their digital content than smaller less deep-pocketed startups or competitors. In short, richer company\u2019s digital content will work better. It seems like a capitalist morality play: today\u2019s network providers should reap the benefits of their substantial, involved investments in building the technical infrastructure of the world wide web that we all use, no? They helped build it and make it work so they should control it right? That\u2019s definitely one way to look at it. Another way to characterize it might be: A nightmarish group of cartels re-establishes a monopolist culture (a culture our country started trying to stamp out over 100 years ago maintaining that a level playing field should exist in the market where businesses compete) and in doing so destabilizes the delicate, innovative, risk-taking businesses borne of the Internet \u2014 the companies that help defined and create the value of the Internet. At the risk of sounding dramatic (too late, I know), it\u2019s an issue I\u2019m personally passionate about, but everyone has to make up their own mind where they stand on it. Honestly, it\u2019s great that the FCC is listening \u00a0and hopefully they\u2019re\u00a0not just going through the motions here. I wish us all luck after Sept. 15.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/how-to-crush-your-hackathon-demo/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:   Brandon Kessler is the founder and CEO of  ChallengePost ,\u00a0a platform to showcase software, online competitions, and hackathons. It\u2019s sad to stay up for three days building something awesome only to bomb the demo presentation. It\u2019s no surprise it happens: you\u2019re exhausted and racing to finish your project, with little time to plan your words, and only a few minutes to say them. So here\u2019s some advice on how to give a great hackathon presentation. 1. Quickly set the scene Why did you build this? In a few sentences, explain the problem you\u2019re solving, or the status quo you\u2019re greatly improving. The more the audience grasps the problem, the better. But remember, keep it short and to the point. Some examples: \u201cWe all know doing math homework is a total drag, so\u2026 I  created a robot to do it .\u201d Or, \u201cUrban planning is one of the most complex professions in the world. The tools on the market are expensive, outdated, and use two dimensions when the world has moved to 3D. I wanted  to change that .\u201d 2. Demo your  working  project Now that you\u2019ve set the scene, it\u2019s time for the most important part: showing your project in action. Decide what\u2019s important to show within the time you\u2019re allotted. Briefly mention key technologies you used, or impressive technical challenges you overcame. Skip mundane flows such as creating user credentials, and have any needed text copied to your clipboard. Whatever you do, it\u2019s crucial to show resolution to the problem you initially identified so your audience can see a) what your project does, and b) that you\u2019ve completed the key components of it. 3. Quickly wrap it up and sell the dream Now that you\u2019ve shown your project actually helps solve the problem you identified, spend a sentence or two highlighting its potential and any ambitions you have, so your audience understands its long-term impact. 4. Crush your online presentation Most hackathons require you to submit your projects online first so you get maximum exposure, and because judges use the platform to determine finalists. Start early as it will pay dividends and help you crystallize your thoughts. Like your verbal demo, a great online presentation will describe the problem you\u2019re solving, show what the hack specifically does, and highlight its potential impact. You should mention the technologies you used, anything interesting you learned, and give credit to your teammates. The best presentations we see on our platform include screenshots and a video demo. And remember, just because the hackathon ends, you don\u2019t have to stop hacking. Keep updating your project so your fans stay in the loop.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/the-revival-of-semiconductor-funding/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:   Ilgiz Akhmetshin is a business development and marketing at  SKTA Innopartners . Ilgiz has a diverse experience in IT and Information Systems.\u00a0 Over the past few years the semiconductor funding ecosystem experienced a downturn. According to the GSA survey, there were only five Series A semiconductor funding rounds and 10 exits in 2010 in North America, Europe and Israel. Most of the VCs who invested in semiconductors shifted their focus to software startups due to higher scalability, faster time-to-exit and low cost of failure. However, I believe semiconductor funding hit bottom in 2013, and it is slowly coming back. I analyzed publicly available transaction data from\u00a0 CrunchBase\u00a0 and discovered promising insights about recent funding trends. Exodus of VCs Expensive capital expenditures There are multiple reasons why semiconductor startups are no longer attractive to VCs. The first reason is the amount of capital that startups need to advance from the concept to proof-of-concept stage. Usually, it takes up to 18 months and up to $1 million to design and test the concept and an additional $2 million to receive the first sample chip. The amount of capital required to start a semiconductor startup increases the potential impact of the\u00a0 technology risk that VCs cannot mitigate, since there is no opportunity to fail fast. Given this funding structure, venture capitalists shied away from semiconductor startups. Consolidated industry The second reason semiconductors are no longer attracting VCs is the mass consolidation in the semiconductor industry. With few remaining industry giants there are few potential\u00a0acquirers\u00a0(i.e.\u00a0exit\u00a0opportunities) and few potential large customers that could enable the startup to scale. For example, one of the biggest pain points in the industry is the lack of a cheap and reliable EUV light source for sub-10nm nodes. There have been several startups with viable solutions; each seeking around $2-3 million to bring their product to the market. However, only one customer, who could provide opportunities to scale the business, exists \u2013  ASML , which\u00a0has already invested in  Cymer . This situation makes it very tricky for the startups to raise funding. Another example would be the cost of design tools. There are only two:  Cadence  and  Synopsys . Each license for a small startup team ranges from $50K to $75K per seat per year. This significantly increases the burn rate of the startups. Long sales cycle Long sales cycles\u00a0is\u00a0a third issue making semiconductor startups\u00a0less attractive to investors. Let\u2019s say a startup has successfully addressed all the problems and creates the best chip. On average, it will take approximately three years to get the chip from design-win to general availability in the market.\u00a0 Calxeda \u00a0had a viable and attractive product but failed to ramp sufficient sales in time to remain viable. Lack of opportunity to get the market traction fast significantly hinders the startups\u2019 ability to raise initial funding. Semiconductor Startup Funding Is Coming Back Regardless of all the problems mentioned above, it seems the semiconductor funding ecosystem is slowly recovering. Looking at the first six months of 2014 data, one can see that the number of funding rounds increased from 30 to 35 and the number of\u00a0funded\u00a0startups increased from 27 to 31. Even though the increase may seem negligible and statistically insignificant, the real change is hidden in the types of these deals. In the first half 2012 of the 32 investment rounds, only two of them were investments in new companies. The rest of the investments were follow-up rounds into companies funded before. The same trend continued during the first six months of 2013 with only three startups funded. However, this year there is a significant upward trend in new semiconductor startup funding with almost 20 new startups funded from January through June. Also, it seems LPs have renewed interest in semiconductors and core technologies.  Walden International  recently raised a $100 million semiconductor fund. Also, I heard some rumors about one of the foundry companies considering launching a startup incubator/accelerator program. Lack of funding has been a dominant pain point for capital-intensive startups for the past few years. However, it appears investors are coming back to this space. I hope the trend continues and fuels core technology innovation, enabling a new generation of\u00a0IoT\u00a0devices and creating industry changing applications.

Well, people have showed up to Curious in droves, with more than 3 million lessons viewed and 10,000 available lessons on the company\u2019s learning platform, according to Kitch. To organize all that content, Curious now has organized the site into eight categories including: Crafting; Brainy, which is an academically focused section; Tech & Biz (which is self-explanatory); Music & Arts, for fine arts, dance, and music lessons; DIY, for makers and home improvement or general repairs; Lifehacking; Languages; Food; and Healthy & Fit.

Taphive\u2019s  ThemeBoard  is something else \u2014 it\u2019s a keyboard that mostly acts like Apple\u2019s, but you can customize it with designs from the community. When Apple releases iOS 8 this fall, users will be able to download the ThemeBoard app from the App Store like any other app. After choosing ThemeBoard as their keyboard in Settings, you\u2019ll be able to go into the app and choose between a variety of keyboard designs submitted from the community. Designers won\u2019t just be submitting designs for \u201cexposure.\u201d ThemeBoard will let designers set prices for their submissions, which will then become available as in-app purchases, with a cut going to the designer. Though the Taphive team doesn\u2019t expect the keyboard to be available until late next month, they\u2019ve already accepted designs from prominent designers in the Apple developer community, including  Christain Billings , one of the  Apple Design Award winners behind Hours. In a chat with\u00a0Taphive co-founder\u00a0Asem Hassan, he explained that the studio wants to enable designers to release their own keyboards without having to do all of the coding work that goes into them behind the scenes. Apple doesn\u2019t provide many common features \u2014 Taphive had to build its own autocorrect, word suggestions, and behavior for things like having the shift key automatically enabled when you correct a word that was already capitalized. To that end, it\u2019s making it as easy as possible for designers to get their work into ThemeBoard. While the data for each custom design is saved in a .plist file, designers don\u2019t have to mess with that at all \u2014 ThemeBoard provides them a template, they put their design on top of it in whatever illustration program they like, and Taphive does all of the conversion on their end. Eventually, the startup plans to release a native keyboard designer for the Mac that will cut out other software from the process and maybe even let designers have an impact on the functionality of the keyboard as well. In addition to\u00a0searching for individual designs, users will be able to install packs of designs focused on themes, like \u201cholidays.\u201d In addition, app developers will be able to create ThemeBoard designs that can be unlocked when their app is installed.

The money will be used for marketing and to build FreeCharge\u2019s offline-to-online advertising platform, which allows brands to target users by tracking their offline purchasing behavior using FreeCharge\u2019s coupons. The company was founded in 2010. Alok Goel, FreeCharge\u2019s CEO, formerly global product management lead for Google Display Ad Network, says FreeCharge \u201cwants to be an offline-to-online bridge in a unique manner.\u201d To use FreeCharge, consumers either go onto its website or mobile app and top up their mobile phones or pay\u00a0utility bills. In return, FreeCharge emails them coupons worth the amount of money they spent, that can be redeemed at businesses like McDonalds, Domino\u2019s Pizza, and Amazon, as well as several major coffee shop and movie theater chains. There are currently about 700 million mobile phone users in India and about 95 percent use a prepaid plan, says Goel. The company\u2019s main competitors are offline shops and other vendors\u00a0where users can top up their phone plans. \u201cIn India, there are 40 million transactions that happen every day in the prepaid mobile phone market. Only a fraction of that is online, but the market is growing rapidly,\u201d says Goel. The company currently claims 10 million registered users and that mobile transactions on Freecharge\u2019s app have increased 30 times since the beginning of this year, with 70 percent of transactions now coming from its mobile app. In terms of advertising, FreeCharge\u2019s main competitors are Facebook and Google\u2019s advertising products and network. In order to compete, FreeCharge plans to use its Series B funding to expand into other forms of advertising. \u201cWe are working on top of the transaction behavior we see from consumers and that insight is totally different than what Google and Facebook have. Google is working search keywords, Facebook is working on demographics, and we work on products that you consume in the offline world. We can see what movie interests you have. We observe what users are buying, based on transaction data that we see, which allows us to build a very interesting ad ecosystem that Google and Facebook don\u2019t have,\u201d Goel says. \u201cWe will use it to expand into a transaction advertising platform. Coupons are one form of transaction advertising, but we have more ideas. We want to create an ad ecosystem around users,\u201d he adds. After focusing on expansion in its domestic market, FreeCharge plans to target other countries where many mobile users use prepaid plans, including markets in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The company recently acquired two companies,  Wishberg  and  Preburn . Wishberg was an acqui-hire, while Preburn is currently developing a product that will provide owners of new smartphones with suggestions for apps they should download. In addition to its Series B, FreeCharge also announced that it has added Gokul Rajaram, Koh Boon Hwee, and Dhiraj Rajaram to its board of advisors. Gokul Rajaram is known as the \u201cGodfather of Adsense\u201d for his role in developing Google\u2019s AdSense network and was also formerly Facebook\u2019s product director of ads. He currently has a  lead role at online payments company Square . Hwee is the chairman of Credence Capital, a private equity fund. Dhiraj Rajaram is the CEO of  Mu Sigma , an analytics services provider. In a statement, Shailendra Singh, managing director of Sequoia Capital India Advisors, said \u201cFreeCharge is creating a unique new category, an advertising platform with the \u2018consumption graph\u2019 for the most valuable online consumers.

In return, Tencent will receive a minority equity stake in DXY. As  Technode (our partner site in China)  points out, Tencent\u2019s investment in a healthcare company is in-line with its competitive strategy against e-commerce giant  Alibaba Group . Alibaba has also made several investments in the healthcare sector, including the  acquisition of CITIC 21CN , a drug data company, in order to  create an app  that lets users scan barcodes to verify the authenticity of their drugs; and its \u201cFuture Hospital\u201d plan, which is  an initiative  to make hospitals more efficient through the use of Alibaba products like online payments service Alipay and cloud computing platform. In a statement from the companies, Tencent will start to offer DXY\u2019s services, which include access to a network of doctors, on several of its platforms, including possible integrations with its popular messaging platform WeChat and microblogging site  Mobile QQ . In turn, DXY will use the investment to further its strategy of moving from products for doctors and pharmaceutical companies to consumer healthcare, including apps like Family Medicine and DXY Doctor. DXY says it plans to provide medical information to consumers by focusing on three categories: products for WeChat, mobile apps, and Web-based services. \u201cGiven the prevalence of fake and inaccurate medical and healthcare information in China, which negatively impacts consumers, DXY is especially focused on ensuring the \u2018reliability\u2019 of the information it provides through its platform,\u201d the company said. In addition, DXY will also use part of Tencent\u2019s investment to create a platform for doctors and pharmaceutical companies to communicate and \u201callow for a more legally compliant and effective way of exchanging ideas and knowledge.\u201d Ting Ting Group said it will also use big data technology to \u201cprovide more accurate and higher value human resource solutions to healthcare companies and medical institutions in China.\u201d Martin Lau, president of Tencent, said that company has been closely following China\u2019s healthcare industry. \u201cWith a rich pool of over two million professional doctors, we understand that DXY is an industry leader in the healthcare industry. Tencent is capable of connecting DXY\u2019s talented pool of healthcare professionals and their medical knowledge database with tens of millions of users.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/nintendo-announces-the-new-nintendo-3ds/", "content": "First released in 2011, the Nintendo 3DS has been re-released both as the bigger 3DS XL and as the the cheaper, kid-friendly 2DS. In  today\u2019s \u201cNintendo Direct\u201d  video update, Nintendo announced the \u201cNew Nintendo 3DS,\u201d an update to the platform that\u2019s somewhere between a minor update and a full-fledged follow-up. The most obvious\u00a0changes are immediately visible on the outside of the device. The face buttons \u2014 A, B, X, and Y \u2014 are colored in a pattern similar to those on the classic SNES console. Instead of one button on each shoulder of the device, there are now two.\u00a0If you look just above the face buttons, there\u2019s now a second analog nub. Looking deeper,\u00a0Nintendo says that the console will have a faster processor and more RAM. That means the device can offer better visuals than before, letting developers bring over experiences closer to what they offer on Nintendo\u2019s Wii U (the fact that it now offers a control scheme that\u2019s almost exactly the same helps too). Unfortunately, that also means that games built specifically for the New Nintendo 3DS (like an upcoming port of the cult-hit RPG  Xenoblade Chronicles ) won\u2019t be backwards compatible with older models. Nintendo also packed NFC into the device so that it can be used with Nintendo\u2019s  Skylander -like Amiibo figurines. Super Smash Bros.,  one of the first games Nintendo showed with Amiibo support built-in , comes out in October, so it\u2019s probably no coincidence that the New Nintendo 3DS comes out in Japan October 11. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no word from Nintendo on the release date here in North America or in Europe. The New Nintendo 3DS will come in two sizes, one roughly the same size as the original 3DS and another that\u2019s roughly the same size as the 3DS XL (though each will have a bigger screen than either of those previous models). Speaking of the screen, Nintendo claims that it\u2019s finally fixed one of the biggest issues with its 3D implementation: if you didn\u2019t look at it head on, it was a blurry mess. Now, the device uses the front-facing camera and gyroscopes to \u201caim\u201d the 3D effect at your eyes, like a cheap version of the  Amazon Fire Phone\u2019s Dynamic Perspective feature. While it\u2019s nice to see a Nintendo release a faster version of its popular console with better controls, I can\u2019t help be confused by how Nintendo chose to announce it. The New Nintendo 3DS is\u00a0backwards compatible with older 3DS games, \u00a0but it will also have its own exclusive titles. Is it supposed to be its own, new device, or not? If it is, I worry that Nintendo is shooting itself in the foot by not coming out with a bigger bang and a new name. This new device is an even smaller incremental jump than from the Wii to the Wii U, and anecdotally, most people I\u2019ve asked over the last few years didn\u2019t realize that those are two different systems.", "tags": "[\"3ds\", \"video games\", \"Gaming\", \"Nintendo\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/new_nintendo_3ds.png?w=680&h=355", "title": "Nintendo Announces The \u201cNew Nintendo 3DS\u201d "},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/tripcast-is-a-beautiful-travel-journal-for-iphone/", "content": "A new mobile application called  Tripcast , built by the team that created  photo-sharing app   Cluster , allows travelers to privately share their photos with their friends back home. The app lets\u00a0you create a travel journal of sorts, by not only collecting the photos and sharing them, but also plotting them on map, and inviting fellow travelers to build albums with you. This is not the first time the team from Cluster has worked on a secondary project in the photos space \u2013 they also  previously released a handy tool for designers and developers called Screenshotter , which helps you organize your iPhone screenshots into more usable albums. Like that earlier effort, which was more of a side project, Tripcast also takes the larger idea from Cluster involving mobile photo albums and private sharing, and spins it off into a niche aimed at a particular crowd. On Cluster, users can build collaborative albums of any sort, whereas Tripcast is aimed only at travelers and their friends. Explains Cluster co-founder and CEO Brenden Mulligan, the new application isn\u2019t really a side project this time, but is an \u201cextension of Cluster.\u201d \u201cA ton of people use Cluster to create travel journals, but wanted features that don\u2019t really fit inside our main app,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, travelers wanted to see the photos they were sharing posted on a map, but when we added a map to Cluster it seemed very out of place in albums that weren\u2019t travel related.\u201d Other times, the users just wanted to share where they were, without attaching a photo every time. \u00a0 Tripcast has been built in a way where the map is more central to the experience, so users can share\u00a0their location as they post other trip notes, photos and videos. They can either create these travel journals by themselves or with their travel buddies by inviting them to join. And when users return home, they can download all the photos that were shared. Meanwhile, friends and family back home are notified when there\u2019s new content, and can like and comment on individual posts very much like you could on Facebook, or any other social network. The difference, of course, is that Tripcast is private \u2013 you\u2019ll have to be invited\u00a0to an album in order to see the content shared. The only issue I have with Tripcast or Cluster is that the sign-up flow\u00a0requires you to invite your friends before you can start building your album. Although the app informs you the user won\u2019t be contacted yet, having to stop and think about who you\u2019re going to invite \u2013  and do you have their email? should you use that or their phone number?  \u2013 can mentally slow you down. I\u2019d love to be able to jump into the more fun right away, which is curating your photos into an album. That said, like Cluster, Tripcast is another polished, well-built app from a talented team. It may not be something you use everyday (unless you travel for work, or lead an  amazing  life), but it\u2019s a viable alternative to Facebook for sharing travel photos. The app is free  here on iTunes \u00a0and  here on Google Play .", "tags": "[\"travel\", \"Mobile\", \"Apps\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/screen-shot-2014-08-29-at-1-31-58-pm.png?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/screen-shot-2014-08-29-at-1-32-13-pm.png?w=680&h=364 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/screen-shot-2014-08-29-at-1-32-28-pm.png?w=680&h=383", "title": "Tripcast Is A Beautiful Travel Journal For Your Smartphone "},

In 2014, around 233 million tablets and 2-in-1 devices will be sold, according to the group. A number of things emerge from the above: Tablet sales won\u2019t catch PC sales for a lenghty\u00a0period of time. Yearly PC sales have roughly  stabilized around the 300 million unit level , meaning that tablet sales will likely have to grow by a large percentage to meet PC sales, which, as the new numbers indicate, will not be easy. Another point of context: Quarterly smartphone sales are  substantially larger  than yearly tablet sales, a gap that is increasing. Tablets, regardless of what was thought, are the smallest of the PC, tablet, and smartphone troika.\u00a0And as only smartphones of the group are growing quickly, we shouldn\u2019t expect the\u00a0internal ranking order to change much. Could tablet sales begin to decline in mature markets? Negative growth in mature tablet markets would shift all growth pressure to emerging markets. It isn\u2019t clear if those other areas could grow enough to expand net tablet volume in that context I think that if we had all sat around a table in mid-2013, and asked ourselves if PC sales would stabilize as quickly as they have, and tablet sales growth would slow as quickly as they have, we would have laughed at the idea. That\u2019s not to say that tablet sales aren\u2019t a large part of the consumer hardware market, just that they appear to one of more minor import than we might have anticipated.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/predictive-first-how-a-new-era-of-apps-will-change-the-game/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note: \u00a0 Vik Singh is CEO of\u00a0 Infer . Over the past several decades, enterprise technology has consistently followed a trail that\u2019s been blazed by top consumer tech brands. This has certainly been true of delivery models \u2013 first there were software CDs, then the cloud, and now all kinds of mobile apps. In tandem with this shift, the way we build applications has changed and we\u2019re increasingly learning the benefits of taking a mobile-first approach to software development. Case in point: Facebook, which of course began as a desktop app, struggled to keep up with emerging mobile-first experiences like Instagram and WhatsApp, and  ended up   acquiring them  for billions of dollars to play catch up. Recent events like the  acquisition of RelateIQ by Salesforce  demonstrate that we\u2019re at the beginning of another shift toward a new age of predictive-first applications. The value of data science and predictive analytics has been proven again and again in the consumer landscape by products like Siri, Waze and Pandora. Big consumer brands are going even deeper, investing in artificial intelligence (AI) models such as \u201cdeep learning.\u201d Earlier this year,  Google spent $400 million to snap up AI company DeepMind , and just a few weeks ago,\u00a0 Twitter bought another sophisticated machine-learning startup called MadBits . Even Microsoft is jumping on the bandwagon, with claims that its \u201c Project Adam \u201d network is faster than the leading AI system, Google Brain, and that its Cortana virtual personal assistant is smarter than Apple\u2019s Siri. The battle for the best data science is clearly underway. Expect even more data-intelligent applications to emerge beyond the ones you use every day like Google web search. In fact, this shift is long overdue for enterprise software. Predictive-first developers are well poised to overtake the incumbents because predictive apps enable people to work smarter and reduce their workloads even more dramatically than last decade\u2019s basic data bookkeeping approaches to customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning and human resources systems. Look at how  Bluenose  is using predictive analytics to help companies engage at-risk customers and identify drivers of churn, how  Stripe \u2019s payments solution is leveraging machine learning to detect fraud, or how  Gild  is mining big data to help companies identify the best talent. These products are revolutionizing how companies operate by using machine learning and predictive modeling techniques to factor in thousands of signals about whatever problem a business is trying to solve, and feeding that insight directly into day-to-day decision workflows.\u00a0But predictive technologies aren\u2019t the kind of tools you can just add later. Developers can\u2019t bolt predictive onto CRM, marketing automation, applicant tracking, or payroll platforms after the fact. You need to think predictive from day one to fully reap the benefits. By focusing on predictive as your key product differentiator, you can more easily prioritize a minimum viable product that is intuitive and powerful. When you cut to the core of the most critical problems your product is trying to solve with data, you can design super simple flows that leverage the data in the right ways. Then you\u2019ll have a leg up and can avoid wasting time on features that unnecessarily require your users to set up complex configurations and preferences. Focus is also the reason many desktop apps are switching to a mobile-first approach rather than building every bell and whistle they can implement on a big screen and trying to make the hard trade-offs to carve out a differentiated mobile version later. Pandora did this well by bringing smart recommendations into its product early on, which simplified the experience dramatically. Instead of building a music experience that had all the bells and whistles of iTunes, they focused on suggesting and predicting the next best song for the user. That focus gave them unique positioning so they could stand out from a marketing perspective. In addition, it meant they could develop world class technology and make their recommendations top notch versus stretching their technical assets across too many \u201cme-too\u201d features. Simplification is particularly important for predictive companies, because getting tangled up in too many of your customers\u2019 processes and data sources behind the enterprise firewall all at once often lands you in the consulting trap. That\u2019s why the majority of business intelligence vendor revenues actually come from support, consulting and services \u2013 i.e. customizing models and data extraction, transformation and loading scripts for each customer. Starting with predictive from the get-go is the best way to become an expert on the data you\u2019re partying on. Then you can truly understand things like how to track or snapshot all your fields properly, where data can go in and out, and all the \u201chackery\u201d required\u00a0to work with third-party systems like Salesforce and Marketo (you\u2019ll often need to develop workarounds that even insider folks there may not be aware of). When you\u2019ve invested in learning about the particular sources of data, it\u2019s much easier to focus on the things that will help you break through \u2013 like designing your system in a way that\u2019s amenable for predictive modeling, building the right model features, and creating a scalable user experience. Also keep in mind that predictive-first means saving all the data you can, just as Google does. The search giant has gone to great lengths to build the most advanced data infrastructure and data centers on the planet in order to maintain and protect its data. Google treats data like it\u2019s gold waiting to be mined, and it is time everyone else follow suit. Predictive applications require a well-thought out architecture that captures a broad swath of signals for training predictive models. Unfortunately, today\u2019s enterprise software is rooted in legacy approaches from back when disk space was expensive and data analytics (let alone predictive analytics) was in its infancy. I imagine if CRM systems were built from the ground up today \u2014 with a predictive-first mindset \u2014 their design would be very different, they would be more aggressive in data snapshotting and collection (for example, turning history tracking on for all fields by default), and their workflows and trigger functions would be based on predictions as opposed to manual, fragile, non-adaptive rules. To scale a predictive solution for enterprise use, you need to pick one precise problem and source of truth for your data, work with a few customers to start and go deep. During this process, you should determine common denominators, revamp your product around those features, and test it until you nail repeatability. Then blow it out to many more customers, break the product, and repeat the earlier steps until you get it just right. This requires unbelievable product focus and data science work that\u2019s only been seen in the consumer world until now. No one\u2019s built a repeatable predictive application in the enterprise before because it\u2019s really hard to do without getting caught up in consulting around individual customer requirements. And this iteration process is nearly impossible under the weight of owning a popular platform that\u2019s predictive-last, because you\u2019re pressured to scale your solution immediately to thousands of customers. When you\u2019re developing for legacy systems, you don\u2019t have the time and patience to test with a few customers and learn and grow. In addition, this issue is compounded by the fact that the new workflows you\u2019re generating fundamentally question and cannibalize your existing manual rule-based workflows. Rather than providing basic data bookkeeping services, enterprise software developers should be rethinking how people work and finding new ways to leverage data that make employees more efficient and effective. If we do this well, the next generation of business applications will prove vital for companies of all types and sizes as they make the shift to becoming data-driven businesses.", "tags": "[\"predictive analytics\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/1749632825_0a155c635b_o.jpg?w=738", "title": "Predictive First: How A New Era Of Apps Will Change The Game"},

Based in Bulgaria, the peripatetic VC is almost everywhere, showing up at events around the world and scouting out some amazing ideas. I talked to him about how he became a VC at a comparatively young age and what it takes to make it in investing for our  back to school series . TC: You\u2019re pretty young (comparatively). How did you start? \nGurvits: I co-founded an online legal services company in Holland, made a small exit in 2011, moved to Bulgaria to found my next company, instead got involved in setting up an EU-backed accelerator ( Eleven ), then moved out to do personal investments, and ended up raising a private fund for regional post-traction companies ( Teres Capital ). I\u2019m 30, still a year older than Sam Altman. TC: What did you study? \nMG: I studied law in Holland, did scholarships at UW-Madison Law School and at Bologna University. TC: Can students be good entrepreneurs? \nMG: Students often make good founders because they\u2019re usually too inexperienced to know better. One of my best stories is a 16-year old from a small town in rural Bulgaria, who got into YC (W14), becoming the youngest founder ever in that program. He\u2019s a Thiel fellow now and will be launching a new iOS e-mail client this September (let me know if you want the scoop on that). The younger the founders, the better they seem at doing really big stuff, and not \u201cjust\u201d unlocking another cloud B2B vertical or another connected hardware thing. TC: Sure. Give us the school. What do you look for in terms of investments? MG: I always look out for the combination of boldness / big ideas, and the maturity to play nice and keep ego in check. TC: What are you doing now? Why did you focus on Europe in general and Central Europe in particular? MG: I\u2019m currently working to close our fund, continuing with pre-fund angel syndications (we already did four, including  Flipps.tv , and numbers 5 and 6 are coming up). Apart from this, I\u2019m consulting a number of CEE angel networks, accelerators, and organizing my #FTW startup events. I honestly believe CEE is the next big thing. Once the hype and EU-funded nitwits are pass\u00e9, we\u2019ll see a surge of serious activity, focusing on extremely good local conditions for building global stuff.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/ycs-billforward-wants-to-change-the-way-youre-charged-for-subscriptions/", "content": "Amazon Prime, Netflix, utilities, the New York Times, HBO Go, the gym\u2026 When you stop and think about all the subscriptions you have, the list probably is a bit longer than you thought. But even as more subscription services become available, from ride shares to  make up kits , it seems companies still offer customers limited subscription options due to constraints with their billing systems. Subscriptions rarely take into account how much you actually use them (If they did,\u00a0most of us would probably be paying a lot more for Netlfix and a lot less for the gym). Calling themselves \u201cStripe for subscription billing,\u201d  BillForward \u00a0helps companies create customized billing services.  BillForward CEO and co-founder Mark Parry  said current subscription billing service software is outdated or difficult to use, and its time consuming and costly for companies to build their own. The service allows companies to charge fixed subscription rates, but it can also introduce other variables such as usage or take account days like holidays that might not require charges. A good example of a company already implementing BillForward is  Y Combinator\u2019s LivBlends , the company that made a Keurig-like machine for smoothies and delivers them to businesses in bulk at the same time every week. LivBlend\u2019s ordering page is powered through BillForward. On the website, users can choose what days they want the smoothies delivered, how many they want, what size and what flavors. BillForward then charges a subscription rate, taking into account holidays such as Labor Day that may affect how many smoothies the company orders. Parry said with existing\u00a0subscription models, most small companies would only offer consumers a few different options. With BillForward, the pricing and choices\u00a0can be much more customized. BillForward isn\u2019t the first subscription billing solution.  Zuora  offers software for companies ranging from startups to high volume multi-divisional enterprises.  Recurly \u00a0also provides a recurring billing platform. But the founders\u00a0say they\u2019re already seeing businesses using these companies express interest in switching to BillForward. Ian Saunders, the BillForward CTO and co-founder,  said installation of the BillForward API is\u00a0fast and never takes more than a few days, even when it is customized. The service also gives businesses analytics tools so they can easily check their revenue and growth. Parry said companies using the service have already seen\u00a0increased revenue-by-average-user by 10%. Right now\u00a0BillForward\u00a0is focused on small startups that generate about $25 million in revenue. But the company has grown rapidly since joining\u00a0Y Combinator, and gained about 120 new businesses in the past few weeks. Parry said he expects the company to accommodate much larger businesses in the coming month. Parry and Saunders founded the company with Aubone Tennant began BillForward about 18 months ago in London. In December the team began looking to expand its offices to Silicon Valley. They opened their second office in San Francisco in early 2014, and then started with Y Combinator in the spring. Parry\u00a0again and again had one word to describe the Y Combinator program \u2014 \u201cfantastic.\u201d \u201cHaving gone through the process, I would recommend it to anyone considering,\u201d Parry said. \u201cSome people are concerned about the 7 percent equity, but it\u2019s worth 14 percent.\u201d And it makes sense that a company for companies would feel that way.\u00a0Just as Stripe benefited from other Y Combinator companies using its technology as they scaled up, so will BillForward. In addition to LivBlends, Several companies from this YC batch are already on board, including\u00a0Roost and Front. After presenting earlier this month at YC Demo Day, BillForward is raising a seed round. \u00a0", "tags": "[\"BillForward\", \"Startups\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/ipad-black3.jpg?w=738", "title": "YC\u2019s BillForward Wants To Change The Way You\u2019re Charged For Subscriptions"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/niall-is-making-luxury-watches-in-kansas-city/", "content": "When you think of Kansas City a few things come to mind: barbecue, blues, and \u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont, the first Frenchman to settle the area and his excellent treatise \u201cExact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony.\u201d And now, thanks to  Niall , you think of luxury watches. This tiny watchmaking startup uses American-made parts and embeds Swiss movements. Founded by Michael Wilson, a former marketer whose father owned a fabrication shop where he learned how to cut and shape metal on industrial equipment, the company is offering a line of $4,000 automatic watches handmade in the U.S. \u201cAll of this started from a passion for watches paired with a background in manufacturing and entrepreneurship. As we explored what it would take to build a watch, we were disappointed to find so many watch brands were shipping all the production to China / Germany and simply white labeling their products,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cAfter reading an article in the Economist we learned the average Chinese watch costs $2 to make \u2013 while the average Swiss watch costs around $685 to make. This opened our mind to how the market currently worked and how there was need for a little industry shake up.\u201d The name Niall is tangentially related to Wilson\u2019s Irish heritage but it is also a testament to the durability of their pieces. The crystal, for example, is made of Gorilla Glass, probably one of the first uses of that material in watchmaking. The company sources its materials from across the U.S. \u2013 screws and cases from Pennsylvania, bracelets from New York, and crowns (the little winding stems) from San Francisco.  The movements come from Switzerland. \u201cAll our cases and bezels are CNC cut from a solid block of 316L stainless steel and drilled and tapped utilizing a special machine from the same guys that do the CNC cutting. Why that is important is because finding someone in America that can thread a 1mm hole (for the screws) into hardened steel is rare. We shopped over 75 CNC shops to find two that best fit our requirements,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cThe dials are stamped from 7075 aluminum and then the logo and tick marks are laser etched in Kansas City. We didn\u2019t use paint (industry standard) so what you are seeing is actual metal and therefore will never wear or fade.\u201d The watches are shipped from a spring works factory in Kansas City. \u201cIt\u2019s elite and it\u2019s American,\u201d he said. The watches themselves are evocative of Hublot or Audemars-Piguet but the handsome back-slung lugs and the understated face are unique to the brand. The cheapest watch is $3,950, on par with other American competitors like  RGM  and  Xetum . The goal is to expand the Niall brand into more products and they do have plans for an American-made watch movement that will replace Swiss movements that are now harder and harder to source. Watchmaking is a dying art and it\u2019s great to see small manufacturers entering it with gusto. While the Niall will never be mistaken for a Rolex at parties, at least you\u2019ll have a story to tell about a tiny Kansas City manufacturer\u2019s race to build an all-American watch.", "tags": "[\"Startups\", \"watches\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/tk8j4j9gfflnekdin2g8796ivirhpeetizxgiyjxk-w.jpeg?w=738 http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/techcrunch-2013/assets/images/1x1.png?m=1381219147g", "title": "Niall Is Making Luxury Watches In Kansas City"},

If you think they\u2019re all annoying gimmicks, well, uh, you\u2019re going to be seeing more of them anyway. That\u2019s because the site is building up a games team of its own. Vice President of Product Chris Johanesen told me that the full-time team currently consists of a producer, two designers, and two developers. And Capital New York recently  spotted a job listing for another game developer . Johanesen said he doesn\u2019t know how big the team might get, but the idea is not to \u201cbuild a warehouse somewhere and fill it full of 70 developers.\u201d He added that the team is \u201cnot going to be creating  Grand Theft Auto \u201c, but rather working with the existing editorial team to pursue cool ideas. He attributed BuzzFeed\u2019s interest in this area to  the success of its aforementioned quizzes  earlier this year, which led to increased interest in interactive content. ( Raising that $50 million from Andreessen Horowitz may have helped , too.) The company had a weeklong \u201csprint\u201d where three editors sat down with the games team and came up with as many ideas as possible, resulting (so far) in  this love life forecaster. \u201cWe wanted to create things that people would play with rather than just consume,\u201d Johanesen said.

(See, even BuzzFeed knows that its headlines can get a little ridiculous \u2026) As Johanesen suggested, none of these projects are going to rival \u201creal\u201d games, but he said they requires more technical effort that you might think, particularly when it comes to making sure they work on every possible device. Plus, the team is building out \u201cthe process for being able to move a little quicker to make one-off games.\u201d And yes, you\u2019ll probably start seeing some game-like ads on BuzzFeed too. \u201cWhat this team will look like 10 or 20 years, I don\u2019t know, but we definitely want to hire more developers,\u201d he said.", "tags": "[\"Buzzfeed\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/buzzfeed-headline-generator.jpg?w=690", "title": "Yep, BuzzFeed Is Building A Games Team"},

He\u2019s done marketing for Twilio, Asana, and Salesforce and blogs about  marketing, growth, and storytelling at Threadling . It always breaks my heart a little when the startups with the most radiant potential hit their troughs of disillusionment and then cash out to a deep-pocketed buyer. This is not because I begrudge the founders of these startups the personal wealth or success that comes with their exits. Indeed, the wallets of everyone involved usually get a lot fatter, and that\u2019s fantastic.\u00a0But these cash-outs make me sad because when rocketships get picked out of the sky by sharp-eyed acquirers, they rarely achieve the heights that had been in front of them. So it was with Siri, which started its life as an incredible but unusable app for the iPhone 3GS, but could have been the next Google. At the time that Apple acquired Siri (less than six months after it\u00a0launched), the Siri iPhone app wasn\u2019t close to taking off, and it may have seemed to its founders and investors that this situation was not about to improve. This is because when Siri was merely a standalone app, it\u00a0made you jump through an unreasonable number of hoops to access its\u00a0magic: Like a small handful of observers, I was blown away by the tech that made Siri possible and the promise that it held, but even with my degree of excitement:  Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that . It seemed obvious that for Siri to achieve its\u00a0world-changing potential, it\u00a0had to be integrated with the OS, and there was no way that was going to happen on the iPhone if Apple didn\u2019t own its\u00a0underlying tech, right? Ah, but not so fast. It is somewhat widely known, but never publicly acknowledged, that a company called Nuance has powered iOS\u2019s (and OSX\u2019s) voice-recognition capabilities since Siri went live. Unlike many of the things Apple builds into iOS, it\u00a0does not own Nuance, which has a solid (if fairly boring) business selling voice recognition appliances to enterprises \u2014 and a less healthy business selling dictation software to consumers. To own Nuance, Apple would have had to shell out a few billion dollars and inherit 10,000+ employees and a boring business to boot. For Nuance, Apple just became another customer, licensing its voice recognition tech and integrating its appliances into those\u00a0data centers Apple was busy building at the time. It\u2019s not obvious why a similar arrangement couldn\u2019t have been made between Siri and Apple, had Siri been in a different position when Apple came calling. Indeed, though it may not have looked like it the day Steve Jobs showed up to buy Siri with $300+ million in Apple\u2019s cash, there were a number of paths that could have taken Siri along a much more impactful route\u2014transforming it\u00a0from an app to be opened on an iPhone into a platform to be integrated into every connected human-computer interface in the world that wanted to come along for the ride The particular alternative trajectory for Siri I came up with for the purposes of this post goes like this: Instead of pursuing this or any of the other potential paths to glory and independence, Siri\u2019s founders and/or investors seem to have lost faith when version 1.0 didn\u2019t get traction and decided to take Apple\u2019s cash. Given the pressure and uncertainty and size of the offer, it was not a crazy call. But making the call to cash out, the minds behind this incredible tech lost control of its destiny. If Steve Jobs hadn\u2019t died when he did, maybe his vision and his furious desire to get revenge on Google might have led Siri along a path to ubiquity, but this was not to be. Had they played their cards differently, there\u2019s a meaningful chance that Siri\u2019s creators would now be operating a multi-billion-dollar company. Meanwhile, Siri herself would be shaking up the world, changing the way we interact with the internet, and posing disruptive threats to Google. Instead, it looks like it\u00a0will live out the rest of its\u00a0days as a once-hyped feature of iOS: the beauty that could have been, a glimmer of brilliance \u2014 faded out and dulled by neglect and the passage of time. One can only hope that with Viv,  the recently announced project from two of Siri\u2019s original founders , the dream will be reborn.", "tags": "[\"siri\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/siri-google2.png?w=738", "title": "How Siri\u2019s Founders Could Have Built The Next Google"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/30/in-defense-of-square-smartwatches/", "content": "All the smartphone hype is currently around round watches. When LG and Samsung announced their first Android Wear smartwatches earlier this year, most pundits had a heard time getting excited about them\u00a0\u2014 in part because everybody was still waiting for the round Moto 360. Since then, we haven\u2019t heard all that much about the square watches from those two manufacturers, but\u00a0everybody is still waiting for the Moto 360 and now LG has joined the fray with its own round  G Watch R . The G Watch R looks very nice in  LG\u2019s renders \u00a0\u2014 almost like a mechanical watch. I somehow doubt it will look this good in person (it\u2019s screen only has a slightly higher resolution than the current G Watch, for example). It\u2019s nice to see LG step up its design game, but I don\u2019t quite get the hype around these round watches. Sure \u2013 they look more like \u201creal\u201d watches, but if they work anything like today\u2019s Android Wear watches, the round face isn\u2019t going to be half as cool as you may think. My main problem with these round watches is that while round faces were great for mechanical watches \u2014 what else could you do to display the time before digital watches anyway? \u2014 but smartwatches are about so much more than just showing the time. A round screen is simply an inefficient way of displaying the kind of notifications that Android Wear is designed around.\u00a0On a round screen, you just end up with a lot of wasted screen estate and a slightly awkward look on the actual notifications, because they are often squeezed into the lower part of the circle. Also, remember that in order to get enough\u00a0battery life from their tiny batteries, the screen has to dim to the point where you can barely read the time when you are\u00a0not using the watch. Because of that, glancing at a regular round watch face without large digits\u00a0is almost impossible on these watches \u2014 and if all you are doing is showing large digits on a round face, then what\u2019s the point of a round watch? The only watch faces I\u2019ve found useable on the current LG G Watch, for example, are the ones that use huge numbers. None of the round ones are legible enough when you just want to glance at the watch without doing the full arm gesture that turns on the display. The OLED display on the G Watch should  remedy  some of those issues, but I doubt it\u2019ll be awesome. We\u2019ll get our hands on the final production version of the Moto 360 in the next week or so and see how well the round face works in daily use.

After  launching to provide a common API for K-12 education two years ago ,  Clever  wants to help instructors teach more and worry about resetting students\u2019 forgotten passwords less.\u00a0The education technology company recently launched a feature that will allow students to use a single sign on to all of the  Clever-supported software , which includes\u00a0key education players such as Scholastic and CK-12. Clever  CEO Tyler Bosmeny \u00a0said a recent study showed teachers spent an average of 25.4 percent of their time in computer labs just logging in students. \u201cIt\u2019s really so rare that so many companies come together and solve a common problem,\u201d Bosmeny said. \u201cThis is going to make life a lot easier for so many teachers and students.\u201d Clever\u00a0also reported rapid growth from our last report on their Series A funding round in December that raised $10 million. At the time, Clever was available in 10,000 schools. Now it\u2019s available in 25,000. Bosmeny said\u00a0he attributes much of Clever\u2019s growth to how rapidly the company has taken off in several large school districts, including Miami and Houston. That explosive growth has helped the company attract new software\u00a0partners, including CK-12. CK-12 produces interactive\u00a0digital textbooks to encourage STEM learning.  CK-12 executive director\u00a0Neeru Khosla  said her venture recently partnered with Clever because the company\u2019s impact has become \u201cimpressive.\u201d Khosla said because education technology is moving so quickly, teachers are increasingly running into administrative hold ups. Even before technology played such a role in the classroom, she said teachers were already playing many different supportive roles in the classroom. Guiding students with new technology added to that. \u201cTechnology was another thing teachers had to learn,\u201d Khosla said. \u201cYou only have so much time in a day.\u201d Khosla said because CK-12 has a small number of employees, partnering with Clever was prudent because they do not always have time to focus on student data and making the log in process easier. She said as digital devices become more affordable, the demand for services like CK-12 will grow. \u201cOne of the biggest things we want to encourage is for more developers to go into education,\u201d Khosla said.", "tags": "[\"Education\", \"Education\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/clever-screenshot.png?w=738", "title": "Clever Launches New Instant Log In Feature"},

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/29/multi-factor-analysis-of-y-combinators-summer-2014-class/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note: \u00a0 Matt Oguz \u00a0is managing director of\u00a0 Palo Alto Venture Science . In my previous article, I wrote about how  multi-factor analysis of startups  helps avoid decision biases such as availability \u2014 anchoring or the famous \u201cherd mentality.\u201d The merits of the theories behind this approach go back to the 1950\u2019s. But based on the feedback our team received, we felt encouraged to share a sample analysis with everyone to explain the inner workings of the process. With that in mind, we ran the Y Combinator Summer \u201914 class through our models. First, let\u2019s take a look at the methodology to refresh our memory. The idea behind Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is to instill transparency and consistency to the process of picking alternatives among an available batch. Professors Belton and Stewart state the following in their book,  MCDA \u2013 An Integrated Approach : \u201cSubjectivity is inherent in all decision making. MCDA does not dispel that subjectivity; it simply seeks to make the need for subjective judgments explicit and the process transparent.\u201d A view shared by many others prominent in the field of MCDA is illustrated by the following quotes: \u00a0 Simply stated, the major role of formal analysis is to promote good decision-making. A good analysis should illuminate controversy \u2013 to find out where basic differences exist in values and uncertainties, to facilitate compromise, to increase the level of debate and to undercut rhetoric.\u201d Keeney and Raiffa, 1972 We\u2019ll share our results for only 15 startups here, which we named \u201cbatch one.\u201d First, let\u2019s go over the methodology. Prior to starting to evaluate all startups, we need to weigh the categories against one another to calculate their importance in the decision problem: From here, we need to determine how to evaluate each startup based on all the criteria. To do that, we can assign numerical values, qualitative scales or utility functions to a given criterion. In this analysis, to make things easier, we defined qualitative scales that correspond to scores: Next, we need to determine how we\u2019re going to evaluate each criterion. Market size, for example, is a dimension to be maximized. Competition is to be minimized. We assign the appropriate qualitative scale to each criterion. The figure below shows the weighting of categories and criteria and how we assign parameters. Once we establish the framework comes the fun part of evaluating each startup. This is subjective as mentioned before. Due to space constraints, we\u2019re only able to show four startups, but the rest are evaluated the same way: After all the startups are evaluated, we calculate scores that captures each startup\u2019s attractiveness (or risk) levels based on their perceived scores and the weights of these scores. This process is a lot more powerful than one member of the deciding team evaluating the startups. That way, if someone missed an attribute, others will pick it up. But it is important to perform the evaluations without collaborating; otherwise, a number of biases can arise. The group can decide on the importance of each criterion, but each member should evaluate the alternatives on his or her own. The rankings We\u2019re all naturally drawn to those companies that top the charts. And out of this batch of 15 startups,  Naytev ,  PicnicHealth  and  One Codex  emerge as the top three. We noticed that even though data, big data or analytics weren\u2019t part of our criteria, all three startups are data plays. The spider web charting is useful in visualizing the strengths and weaknesses of each startup. It\u2019s worthwhile to examine the contribution of each criterion to the overall score. This visualization helps with that analysis. Note how the Technology/Product dimension impacts the overall score. There are two other parameters we didn\u2019t cover here because we didn\u2019t have all the information: Pre-money valuations and the amounts being raised by each startup. Naturally, these two qualifications are very important in order to calculate how much \u201cbang for the buck\u201d one can expect. There are different ways to attack this problem. One method is to treat these monetary parameters as part of the criteria set and assign them a percentage, as we did with all the other parameters. The second option is to factor them in later as a standalone parameter and compare them to market averages. Another dimension we didn\u2019t include in the analysis is \u201cpopularity.\u201d We believe that both social proof or popularity are irrelevant when it comes to evaluating the potential of a startup, which is ultimately determined by how the market reacts to the value offering. Some VCs consider \u201cwho else invested in this\u201d as an important parameter and label opportunities as \u201chot deals.\u201d We believe that such an approach increases a number of decision biases with which most of us are familiar at this time. It\u2019s not easy to score attributes like ethics, energy or leadership without an in-depth analysis of a startup. But, given that this group of startups is part of a great program, we weighed those attributes heavily. However, we did wonder if that was a bias. (It is.) This analysis helps us structure the problem, provides a focus and a language, and establishes an audit trail. It doesn\u2019t seek to replace intuition, but it complements and challenges it. Visualizing the attributes that\u00a0impact the economic merits of each startup is more important than any single element, such as the type of problem the startup tries to solve. In this batch, there were quite a few that aimed at big problems. Issues such as legal and regulatory risk and state of technology (concept, MVP, Alpha, Live 1.0, etc.) are important to consider when attacking big problems. We noticed that this batch of YC startups spans a variety of subverticals. The startups attack problems with varying economic and social impact. You can see the path to monetization much clearly in some of them and not so easily in others. Which ones will emerge as big winners? It\u2019s too soon to tell. There are three ways to invest in this batch. If you have lots of capital to deploy and are not concerned about early losses, you can invest in a lot of them at the same time. If you\u2019re a thrill-seeker, then you can pick one of the ones you like the most and bet big. If you\u2019re an advocate of a rational investment methodology, the multi-factor framework presented here is a great starting point. In conclusion, we wish good luck to all startups and those who bet in their success.", "tags": "[\"Y Combinator\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/ycombinator.jpg?w=738 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/oguz_yc1.png?w=300&h=418 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/oguz_yc2.png?w=487&h=542 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/oguz_yc3.png?w=680&h=680 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/oguz_yc4.png?w=680&h=373 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/oguz_yc5.png?w=456&h=680 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/oguz_yc6.png?w=680&h=663 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/oguz_yc7.png?w=680&h=429", "title": "Multi-Factor Analysis Of Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2014 Class"},

Huggy Rao and Robert Sutton, the authors of  \u201cScaling Up Excellence: Getting To More Without Settling For Less,\u201d \u00a0will bring the lessons they learned from their research to the virtual classroom.\u00a0When\u00a0their five-week, free MOOC launches on Sept. 15,\u00a0it will feature interviews with prominent investors like  Ben Horowitz  and  Michael Dearing . Normally Rao and Sutton teach the book in their executive education classrooms, but true to their research, they\u00a0found\u00a0the MOOC to be a scaling tool that could help them reach more readers. \u201cThey can not only consume the book as in reading it, but more importantly they can actually apply it to their own venture or startup idea,\u201d said Rao, a professor at the  Stanford Graduate School of Business . Sutton, a professor at the  Stanford School of Engineering , said the pair has experience in teaching for-credit online courses in the past. He said this is most likely the only time that the course will be offered in the free MOOC format. \u201cIt will particularly be helpful to entrepreneurs trying to scale their ventures [...] because when people think about scaling they think about the footprint,\u201d Rao said. \u201cThe footprint won\u2019t survive and it certainly won\u2019t thrive unless you have a mindset to sustain it. Because the course is a MOOC, it is open to everyone, but Rao and Sutton said fledgling entrepreneurs would benefit the most from the class. The course specifically focuses on what small ventures can do once they get funding and are looking to scale their businesses. In addition to offering advice from famous investors, Rao and Sutton will include interviews with successful entrepreneurs, including some who they used for their own research. The course will include an interview with the founders of Pulse and an executive from Survey Monkey. Sutton called the Pulse founders  Ankit Gupta and Akshay Kothari  \u201cstars\u201d of the scaling book, saying they told a story that gave him and Rao important perspective that they hope to share with the MOOC students. When Gupta and Kothari were scaling their business, they began to run into many more problems. They realized that by splitting into smaller subgroups and then reporting what each group did at the end of the day, they could be more effective and efficient. \u201cTo us that\u2019s a scaling problem that comes up quite frequently,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cIt\u2019s one that a lot of founders run into.\u201d When it comes to scaling a venture, Sutton said there should be three ideas that students take away from the course. The first is that it\u2019s a process of both addition and subtraction. \u201cThere\u2019s always the stuff that\u2019s getting in the way,\u201d Sutton said. The second is that there needs to be a combination of patience and impatience. Founders need to work aggressively everyday, but also be patient for the long-term awards that work will bring. The third lesson is what Sutton calls \u201cthe grass is browner problem,\u201d which means scaling startups is more messy than stories and research after the fact would lead you to believe. \u201cScaling requires that you drop your tools and develop\u00a0new tools,\u201d Rao said. \u201cWhat got you there won\u2019t get you to the next level,\u201d Sutton added.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/30/drinkmate/", "content": "Devices that plug into smartphones to augment the built-in sensors with additional smarts are continuing to make their way to market, many fueled by crowdfunding.\u00a0Here\u2019s another contender aiming to\u00a0extend the capability of Android smartphones: a teeny breathalyzer called DrinkMate, currently seeking $40,000\u00a0on  Kickstarter \u00a0to make it to market by\u00a0December. The 1.8-inch long device is designed to plug into a powered Micro-USB port and, when used in conjunction with its\u00a0companion\u00a0app, displays a blood alcohol content (BAC) rating after the user has breathed over its semiconductor-based sensor.\u00a0DrinkMate does not require a mouthpiece, the user just blows into an air inlet, which helps keep the design compact and the device hygienic. We\u2019ve seen smartphone breathalyzers before, such as the hefty\u00a0 Alcohoot \u00a0for iPhones, which we covered\u00a0last year. But the DrinkMate is a lot smaller and a lot cheaper, following a Moore\u2019s Law trajectory. It also claims to be able to deliver on the accuracy front \u2014 which is obviously the key aspect\u00a0here, and a claim that remains to be tested given this is still a prototype \u2014 claiming BAC\u00a0measurement levels at an accuracy of +/- 0.01% BAC at a\u00a0BAC of\u00a00.02%. DrinkMate\u2019s\u00a0sensor maxes out at\u00a00.20% BAC but if you\u2019re that drunk you\u2019re unlikely to be  compos mentis \u00a0enough to use this\u00a0gadget, let alone find your car keys. In addition to accuracy levels, it remains to be seen how DrinkMate\u2019s performance\u00a0holds up in rugged, real world environments\u00a0when the drinks are flowing and users may not be following\u00a0best practice testing procedure. A savvy companion app that steps users around\u00a0potential pitfalls,\u00a0such as by ensuring they wait long enough after their last\u00a0drink to avoid an inaccurate rating (based on alcohol in the mouth), is going to be required to avoid misleading readings. DrinkMate\u2019s Washington, DC based makers say the basic idea behind the\u00a0device is to generate a visible, shareable BAC rating as a way to pile more\u00a0peer pressure on groups of drinkers so they\u00a0keep each other safe. That\u2019s a laudable aim, but there is of course a risk of encouraging opposing\u00a0behavior \u2014 so again the tone of the app is important. The current app designs are pretty basic but the makers say they are adding more features weekly. While ever more mainstream interest sensors, from location sensors and motion/health focused hardware,\u00a0are being embedded into phones, more specialist and/or targeted sensor hardware \u2014 such as the DrinkMate\u2019s BAC analyzer \u2014 is something that makes sense as a smartphone supplement. Bottom line: not everyone is going to want or need this type of sensor embedded in their phone but there will be people who see value in\u00a0having various specialized gizmos hanging off their keyring which, after being plugged in, extend the utility of their mobile device. (Or indeed which they wear on their person and connect to their mobile\u00a0via Bluetooth.) Price wise the DrinkMate is\u00a0currently being offered to Kickstarter backers starting at\u00a0$25. The hardware is guaranteed compatible (tested) with the following Android devices: The makers\u2019 say they are planning an iPhone version but only if their Kickstarter campaign for the Android version is successful.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/30/five-factors-in-building-giants-of-the-big-data-era/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0 Navin Chaddha is managing director of  Mayfield , an early-stage venture capital firm. Some of the companies he is currently championing include Gigya, Elastica, Lyft, MapR and Poshmark. As we enter the second half of 2014, it would be fair to say that big data has gone mainstream, attracting  coffee table books ,  multiple industry landscapes ,  consumer  applications, and large amounts of  funding .\u00a0Having seen many technology cycles during our 45 years in venture capital \u2014 including the birth of the PC era, the transition to client-server computing and\u00a0then web-based computing, and the emergence of the cloud and SaaS models \u2014 we have pattern recognition on what it takes for a company to go from startup to leader. Here are some observations we\u2019ve made about what it would take to build a lasting big data company: 1. Transition from a platform to an ecosystem One of the clearest ways to see whether a technology platform is taking hold is to look at how fast the ecosystem is growing around it. For example, in the SaaS era, Salesforce rapidly became a giant because of its expansive ecosystem. Big data will be no different. One thriving big data company that is transitioning from platform to ecosystem is  MapR . It is the only distribution for Hadoop that combines the benefits of open source (community innovation, portability and flexibility) with unique architectural enhancements that provide enterprise-grade dependability, security, and performance. The MapR ecosystem embraces both the flourishing Hadoop open source community as well a rapidly expanding portfolio of partner solutions in the  MapR App Gallery . This enables enterprise customers to easily expand and implement their big data initiatives with ready-made, big data utilities and applications. Another example is  MongoDB , an open-source and leading NoSQL database used by companies for a wide variety of applications. MongoDB is building a significant ecosystem of partners across industries. 2. Solve the messy, hard problems no one wants to touch This is not a particularly glamorous part of the big data world; however, we believe that many big companies will be built doing this work. In the client-server era, data integration pioneer  Informatica  became a giant by tackling tough data integration challenges and has maintained its edge by being positioned as a leader in the Gartner Data Integration Magic Quadrant eight years running. An example of a company to watch in this space is  Trifacta , which\u00a0enables both technical and non-technical analysts to access and transform raw data into actionable data. 3. Reinvent business intelligence for the big data age by providing insights, not just data Companies such as  Business Objects  that empowered line of business executives to gain insights grew into giants in the client-server era. We believe that a similar class of big data companies are in the making with companies such as  Platfora , which are built natively on Hadoop and rapidly deliver insights visually and iteratively. 4. Embed deep domain expertise  Ensure that valuable expertise from your specific domain is embedded into your analytics application so that it cannot be dislodged. SAP became a giant in the software industry using this strategy. We see this valuable domain expertise in big data analytics companies such as  Palantir  which provides human-driven, machine-assisted solutions for specific use cases like anti-fraud and cybersecurity as well as to vertical industries like defense, insurance, healthcare, & law enforcement; and  Splunk  which transforms machine data into insights. 5. Delight your customers with an intuitive interface Give your IT and line of business customers compelling interfaces to interact with their data. Understand how users interact with your application and invest in the details of the user experience to make it intuitive and delightful. For example, Dropbox became a giant after creating a simple, intuitive approach to file sharing that is now shared by more than  200 million  users around the world. Big data companies with intuitive interfaces include  Tableau , which\u00a0can create visualizations to help enterprises easily see, understand and derive insights from their data, and  Elasticsearch , the open-source solution that offers a fast and rich search experience. And what\u2019s coming next? And one more thing, keep your eye on how the Internet of Things will transform the landscape by serving up data in all kinds of new forms. Today it\u2019s thermostats, phones, watches, even drink glasses\u2026 tomorrow data will come from places we have not yet dreamed of. The whole idea of data ownership, lifecycle and ingestion will have to be rethought, spawning new companies. This will give rise to a wave of innovation and companies creating new products and services never thought of or possible before, and existing ones re-imagined.", "tags": "[\"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/giant-data.png?w=738", "title": "Five Factors In Building Giants Of The Big Data Era"},

The UK\u2019s House of Lords has essentially  recommended the extinction  of online anonymity. As usual, judges and politicians don\u2019t understand technology. Anonymity can used for  awful things , yes; but it\u2019s incredibly important. Why? Because cameras keep getting cheaper, and better, and more ubiquitous, as does facial recognition software.

Oh you poor na\u00efve thing. It\u2019s true, particularly enlightened governments may  delay  all this cross-indexing; but nobody will  stop  it. Eventually, ubiquitous public surveillance\u2013a de facto  panopticon \u2013will become too easy, and too cheap, to resist. Eventually, there will be so many cheap cameras, and so many cheap servers processing their data, that you\u2019ll hardly be able to set foot outside of your home without everything you do in any public space\u2013what you do, where you go, and with whom\u2013silently logged on your permanent record. Valuable data which the powers that be (you know, the insurance companies) will use as they see fit. Online anonymity is important because it\u2019s the only kind we can save.

Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.\u201d Yes, anonymity is frequently\u2013in some contexts, even usually\u2013misused. But eliminating it will not eliminate online vileness. Story on women \"paying price for internet's culture of anonymity\" mostly cites comments people made under real names.   nymag.com/thecut/2014/08\u2026 \u2014  Kashmir Hill (@kashhill)  August 12, 2014 There\u2019s also an extremely important place for  pseudonymity , for people who want to maintain a consistent identity without revealing their so-called wallet name. \u201cWe need space to experiment and risk-tolerant environments where people can learn,\u201d  argues  Lydia Laurenson in  The Atlantic . But let\u2019s not confuse the issue; pseudonymity is important, but it is no substitute for true anonymity. For the moment, consider Whisper and Secret, and this  critical analysis of them both  by Austin Hill, who  knows a thing or two  about online security and anonymity. Short version: they both have a lot of work to do. As Noam Chomsky once said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t believe in free expression for people we despise, we don\u2019t believe in it at all.\u201d Anonymity isn\u2019t extraneous to free speech; it\u2019s a crucial component. That doesn\u2019t mean  every  app or forum has to support anonymity. But there have to be ones that do. Banning all anonymity apps, and requiring all online users to register their identities, are the two worst ideas I have heard in some time.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/30/intel-ceo-wearables-fashion-week/", "content": "Intel CEO Brian Krzanich foresees a day when a wearable is no longer seen a one-size-fits-all device that you put on your wrist. That day could be coming sooner rather than later, as Intel-based wearable products will likely be shown off in the coming weeks at  New York Fashion Week . \u201cWearables\u201d is still a nascent product category, but one that Intel has a vested interest in. After all, the company  acquired wearable maker Basis  for around $100 million earlier this year. Intel isn\u2019t alone, however. Everyone from major consumer electronics manufacturers like Samsung and LG to startups like Pebble and Meta, are seeking to create \u201csmart\u201d devices that users can wear. For the most part, wearables have been split into one of two camps \u2014 those targeted at users who want to better connect with and get notifications from their mobile phones and other devices, and others for tracking their activity and fitness levels. Basis is in that latter category. It is best known for making a smart-watch looking device that tracks a wide range of fitness data, including steps, sleep quality, heart rate, and amount of time spent active during the day. As a result, it generally produces a much more comprehensive data set than most competing wearable products on the market today \u2014 after all, the Fitbit Flex, Nike Fuelband, Misfit Shine, and others mostly focus on counting steps and leave things at that. The $150 Basis B1 had a  couple of downsides , however. For one thing, it was bulkier than most of the other fitness trackers out there, and it also had issues with battery life. The biggest issue with the Basis device, however, might just be that it wasn\u2019t exactly attractive to anyone who cared very much about the fashion of what they wore on their wrist. Unlike the sleek design of the Fitbit or Misfit products, it was too obtrusive to be seen as an accessory. Meanwhile, anyone with a love of watches would dismiss it as a possible replacement due to its design aesthetic. Intel didn\u2019t buy Basis for its design chops, however. The company was interested in acquiring the smarts built into that device, and making it available to others. At a dinner last week with a handful of press, Krzanich explained the company\u2019s plans to unleash the technology beyond its existing hardware and open up a whole new generation of wearables with partners. \u201cIf you take a look at [the Basis B1], the sensor technology is superb. If you look at their hardware data relative to any of the other hardware data out there, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Krzanich said. \u201cThey\u2019ve spent a huge amount of time engineering all of the motion of steps and whatever you want to do, and it\u2019s done a very good job of doing that.\u201d There will be another version of the Basis device coming later this year, Krzanich confirmed at the dinner. The bigger opportunity for Intel and for the industry as a whole, however, could come from working with partners to get that technology embedded into new and different form factors. \u201cWe have a great back end, and a great set of sensors, and all of those things are transferrable to almost any device,\u201d he told attendees. And, well, making its technology available to third parties is what Intel does best. \u201cI still don\u2019t want to be in the device business. We always do best when we partner,\u201d Krzanich said. So what kind of partners are we talking about? Surprisingly, it might not be the type of deep-tech consumer electronics brands that you might expect. Instead, it seems like Intel is working with a number of partners that could make wearables more like fashion accessories. Krzanich said to expect some things from Intel at New York Fashion Week, which begins next weekend and extends through the following week. And Krzanich teased that whatever products are put on display will look more like a fashion accessory than what most users have come to think of as wearables today. \u201cWatches are like clothes. And all of these wearables, they\u2019re not that different from clothes. So there\u2019s not going to be one pattern or style that fits all,\u201d he said. That\u2019s important to keep in mind, especially as Intel thinks about opening up a broader market of consumers to buy these products. Most women might scoff at the idea of wearing a Basis watch in its current incarnation, but Krzanich notes that women wear a lot of jewelry \u2014 like necklaces and bangles \u2014 in which the same sort of \u201csmart\u201d technology could be embedded. It\u2019ll all depend on the form factor of course, but it seems like only a matter of time before wearables are no longer synonymous with wrist bands. And Intel wants to be there when that happens.", "tags": "[\"Basis\", \"Intel\", \"Gadgets\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/brian-krzanich.jpg?w=230&h=300", "title": "Intel\u2019s CEO Envisions A Future Where Wearables Don\u2019t Look Like Wearables \u2014 And It\u2019s Not That Far Away"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/30/critical-lessons-from-the-sharing-economy/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note: \u00a0 Raj Kapoor is the co-founder and CEO of  fitmob , previous managing director at Mayfield Fund and former co-founder and CEO of Snapfish. Companies everywhere are jumping on the sharing economy trend. From sharing skills to houses to cars, the sharing economy is transforming many industries. Technology has lowered the barriers so that anyone can provide services blurring the line between \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cprofessional.\u201d The consumer peer-to-peer rental market alone is worth $26 billion. Private investors are noticing as Airbnb recently received a $10 billion valuation, and startups like Lyft, Poshmark, fitmob and Uber, which received a $17 billion valuation in its last round, are gaining traction while consumers benefit from lower prices, higher quality, and unprecedented convenience. But this model doesn\u2019t work for every industry. From my years investing in and running companies in the sharing economy, I\u2019ve noted several necessary ingredients for a company built on this model to succeed: Sharing economy models work great when there is a high degree of consumer pain. As the saying goes, \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d In a lot of markets, consumers are happy with the status quo, and it will be hard to get user adoption. A good example of this is Cherry, which started as an on-demand car-washing service. There wasn\u2019t a high enough pain point and frequency for the consumer to change their habit and adopt it \u2013 despite the convenience. A sharing economy business works best when it\u2019s hacking an everyday pain point and is something that the average consumer would realistically use multiple times a week. For ridesharing and fitness, the consumer pain is more obvious. Until Uber and Lyft, it was impossible to hail a taxi in most cities, a huge pain to force drivers to accept your credit card, and an all-around unpleasant experience in the car. When you look at the fitness industry, it\u2019s generating $75 billion each year on gym fees, yet 60 percent of people who belong to gyms don\u2019t even go and our nation\u2019s growing obesity and inactivity problem are evidence the solution isn\u2019t working. Lyft and fitmob hack these pain points by creating an experience that is fun, accessible with the push of a button, and affordable giving consumers clear benefits that are lacking in traditional services. While it\u2019s great to have a beautifully designed app for a sharing economy marketplace, the offline service experience is harder to master and the most impactful. The consumer remembers the service experience far more than the buttons they pushed to make it happen. The quality and safety risks are high in a sharing economy model as the supplier is not a brand or a professional. For that reason, it\u2019s critical that the offline experience be highly curated to delight consumers, feel safe and be consistent \u2013 especially in the early days when word of mouth is critical. Until the culture and brand of the service is set and there are abundant ratings, each supplier needs to be picked carefully and monitored. It\u2019s tempting for a sharing economy marketplace to simply open its doors and allow any supplier to provide services to consumers and let the market decide. However, this results in a variable consumer experience and may cause negative word of mouth to go \u201cviral\u201d \u2013 a vicious cycle. With Lyft, there is a deep focus on the quality of the offline experience. When Lyft evaluates drivers, they ask themselves \u2013 would I hire this person to work at the front desk of a top hotel? So much of what makes the sharing economy work is based on human connections and community, not technology. One of the biggest challenges in the sharing economy is regulatory laws that either significantly slow down or outright don\u2019t permit these new services. Our current regulatory structure is geared toward professional, large-scale businesses and didn\u2019t contemplate consumers becoming providers in their spare time or the use of public assets to provide these services. What makes it even more challenging is that the regulations are rarely at the national level \u2013 they are often at the city or state level which can be expensive and time consuming for a startup to navigate. Companies rarely succeed in ignoring these regulations. \u00a0They may start that way (you have more leverage if you can show consumer support before petitioning to change regulations), but eventually they work hand in hand with the government and regulators to create a win-win for all parties \u2013 the business, consumers and regulators. Laws need to change to keep up with the new technology, such as what California did for the ride-sharing industry \u2013 the first state to create a new regulatory framework for these startups. Companies also have the responsibility to proactively engage with the city officials to decrease the amount of shutdowns and suspensions that we\u2019ve seen across the country in ridesharing to the current battle with Airbnb and New York. At fitmob, we faced a challenge in using the public parks for residents to have workouts. The park system didn\u2019t contemplate that outdoor fitness would be so popular and it presents challenges in a balanced use of parks. After casually using the parks and hearing of complaints, we reached out to SF Recreation and Parks to work out an agreement that allowed us to work collaboratively. By creating a relationship early we were able to foresee issues and propose solutions that benefit both parties. The common misconception that the sharing economy requires very little capital and just requires some good code and design couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Airbnb, Lyft and Uber have all raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Just to launch fitmob and prove product market fit we raised over $9 million in equity and venture debt financing. Why? First, in the early days it\u2019s critical to curate and have the best \u201csupply\u201d. \u00a0Often times the platform needs to subsidize the best providers to have them forego their current opportunities and solve the \u201cchicken or egg\u201d problem. Lyft, Uber, and fitmob all had to pay providers some sort of \u201cfloor\u201d initially to make it worth their while when consumer demand was not predictable. Second, these are hyperlocal businesses that require very targeted seed marketing to get the flywheel going. Once you\u2019ve nailed the business in one market and move to a new city, it\u2019s like building a new company from scratch. Third, like other startups, there is a war to hire the best talent but these businesses require broader expertise than just tech \u2013 they need local marketing, logistics, market experts and regulatory firepower. It may be cheap to build a marketplace app, but not to provide a consistent high-quality service and scale it across multiple locations. While several companies are on the fast track to successful global businesses in the sharing economy, many entrepreneurs are still figuring out what types of businesses do and don\u2019t work running on this model. One thing is certain \u2013 the future of the sharing economy will be exciting.", "tags": "[\"sharing economy\", \"Collaborative Consumption\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/3746142610_85125bc77a_o1.jpg?w=738", "title": "Lessons From The Sharing Economy"},

There are times when we just can\u2019t help it, though \u2014 some writers are just too darned important. This is gonna be one of those times. Anand Lal Shimpi, namesake founder of the much-adored hardware news/review site AnandTech, announced his retirement from writing today. If you\u2019re any sort of hardware geek, this news probably comes as a bit of a punch in the gut. AnandTech started as an itty-bitty motherboard review site hosted on GeoCities back in 1997, when Anand was just 14. Over the next 17 years, it\u2019s grown into one of the most respected review sites on the Internet. It\u2019s quite rare for a tech review site to be almost universally revered by its audience, but AnandTech has somehow pulled it off for well over a decade. They review hardware to a depth that very, very few publications would even consider approaching, and they do it  insanely  well. AnandTech wasn\u2019t around when I built my first computer, but it\u2019s the site I turned to when I built my second. And my third. And every computer since. While Anand doesn\u2019t get too specific about why he\u2019s retiring from writing at just 32, he specifically notes that he\u2019s not leaving for health or business reasons. It sounds like he\u2019s just ready for something new \u2014 and given that he\u2019s been doing this since he was  fourteen years old , that\u2019s pretty understandable. But fear not: while its namesake may be headed for something new, AnandTech itself isn\u2019t going anywhere. Ryan Smith, previously the site\u2019s Senior GPU Editor, will be taking over as the site\u2019s editor-in-chief. You can find Anand\u2019s  full retirement note here .

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/30/cultural-realities-of-latin-american-entrepreneurship/", "content": "Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0 Derek Footer is the Managing Partner of  Origo Ventures , a fund focused on early stage technology companies throughout the Latin American region, and the CEO of HardTech Labs, a firm focused on building hardware and biotech ecosystems in the San Diego/Baja region. One of the brilliant things about tech leaders and pundits in Silicon Valley is their true passion for entrepreneurship and their belief in the power of the human spirit and intellect. Surrounded by the sight of so many motivated and talented founders in the Valley itself, they assume that this optimistic sensibility can override nearly any obstacle for a dedicated entrepreneur. However, outside of the Valley and particularly in the rest of the world, the reality is more nuanced. Truthfully, as a means of understanding startup culture in the rest of the world, this viewpoint does international entrepreneurs a disservice. Brilliant, hyper-motivated foreign founders inevitably find their way to the Valley, shaping this misperception. But the reality of entrepreneurship outside of the Valley is shaped by culture and policy in ways that add myriad challenging layers to the dream of founding a company and bringing it to success. Valley culture has been maturing for nearly five decades and it was founded in a culture that already exalted individualism \u2013 cultural underpinnings that nurtured entrepreneurial culture. Elsewhere, this is not the case. My experience has been with Latin America, but I think many of the structural impediments apply everywhere. In Latin America, the fundamental cultural impediment to creating a sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystem is lack of individual risk-taking. While this is true at the entrepreneurial level, it is not a crucial element due to other factors compensating \u2013 primarily the attraction of the Silicon Valley lifestyle. However, this is not true in the investor layer, and thus a crucial piece of the infrastructure \u2013 the post-startup financing \u2013 is severely underdeveloped. The cultural factors here are clear: lack of comfort with technology, group decision-making, long decision-making cycles, desire for control and severe discomfort with failure result in an anemic investment community. Consequently, the investment infrastructure necessary to sustain risk-takers is missing \u2013 beyond mostly government-funded accelerators, there is little further investment until Series A. And the Series A funds are also often beneficiaries of government funding. Even then, few deals get funded, resulting in a handful of positive outcomes via local funds or even fewer companies finding funding in the U.S. The rest die or become zombies. But the commentary on non-U.S.\u00a0entrepreneurship lacks this awareness. At a private breakfast for investors, I heard a very prominent partner at a leading Valley fund say to his audience of Latin American investors that there will be no more Facebooks or Googles from the States \u2014 that the next one would be from Latin America. While he had positive intentions, this investor drove home his ignorance of the region. The quality of founders in Latin America is high enough that there will be potential multi-billion-dollar companies (and besides the obvious reality that the next Facebook or Google will likely be from the Valley), but it is unlikely any will \u2013 Latin America has had so few medium-sized successes that no founder is going to turn up a decent exit at the early stages. This isn\u2019t the Valley, where investors and entrepreneurs alike have the resources, confidence and passion to take the chance Mark Zuckerberg did. This is a region where risk-aversion and caution are prominent values. More to the point, a Latin entrepreneur is overwhelmingly incentivized to take the short-term windfall, as a multi-million-dollar exit would make one a rock star locally and ensure funding for their next venture. There is a real and substantial cost to the Silicon Valley hype that spirited entrepreneurship overcomes all obstacles. The strategies that work in Silicon Valley \u2013 particularly the drive for growth over early revenues \u2013 are often fatal to new startups elsewhere. The best accelerators and institutions at the foundation of Latin American startup culture are following the Silicon Valley model \u2013 and incubating and accelerating great companies into a void with a very low chance of further financing \u2013 too early for substantial traction and out of cash. So let\u2019s keep the Valley spirit, but focus on developing appropriate local practices, as follows: There is no all-encompassing solution, but taken together the above points will extend the runway for companies to reach a level of traction that will enable them to survive through revenue, giving them time to succeed. A more sensitive approach to the cultural realities of investing in foreign ecosystems, better cooperation between the players in those ecosystems, a longer-term vision and a willingness to ignore at least some Valley \u201cwisdom\u201d in favor of local knowledge would certainly result in more frequent positive outcomes.", "tags": "[\"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/8332215554_9a9f0d3474_o1.jpg?w=738", "title": "Cultural Realities Of Latin American Entrepreneurship"},

Walter Duncan is a really nice guy and dedicated \u201cteacherpreneur\u201d who has created a test-taking app. His start-up has taken in hundreds of thousands in funding and the accolades from teachers are never-ending. We asked him what it took to be a beginning entrepreneur. TC: Tell me about yourself. What would you call yourself? Duncan: My name is Walter Duncan, and I am a Teacherpreneur. I have spent 15 years of my life in the classroom, many of those years spent in severely under-resourced schools. My passion is helping to close the achievement gap. Though as a society we have come a long way with technology, in many ways it is increasing the gap between rich schools and poor schools. For instance, many schools that are fully resourced and fully funded are able to give each of their students a device or a computer. This ensures that student progress can be easily tracked, and teachers can intervene when necessary to improve student outcomes. In contrast, resource poor schools like the ones I taught in, simply don\u2019t have the budget or infrastructure. My Co-Founder Isaac Van Wesep and I invented Quick Key Mobile out of this context. I needed a way to get data on how my students were performing each day, and use it to ensure that they were mastering each day\u2019s critical concepts. Doing it by hand was a recipe for teacher burnout, so we created an app to solve this problem. Our app, Quick Key Mobile, turns a mobile device into a scanner that allows teachers to grade assessments in paper based classrooms with or without an internet connection. It then gives teachers the student performance data right away. This tool allows a dedicated teacher to improve student performance, irrespective of their school\u2019s infrastructure and budget. I needed this tool, I could not find it in the market, so we created it. TC: What can a student do to become an entrepreneur today? \nWD: There are many great programs that are supporting students in developing entrepreneurial skills. One such program, The Junior Achievement program, has been doing this for quite some time to great effect. But ultimately it comes down to students working to motivate themselves to realize their out of the box ideas. Teachers help best by creating the space and offering encouragement, but the burden of the tasks must be carried by the students. When I speak with young people in classrooms around the country about this very question, I encourage them to start small. I encourage them to make T-shirts and sell them at their church, or make a lemonade stand. The principles of business are all present in those small ventures, and it is a great way for students to get started and acquire experience. TC: What\u2019s the hardest thing about building stuff? WD: Leading multiple teams toward a common goal on a tight deadline is challenging! And then there is the testing, no matter how much you test, you always miss something. TC: What\u2019s your advice to young people starting out in the industry? \nWD: You must be willing to work harder than you ever imagined. Be heartened, you are capable, your capacities expand, the work transforms you. Also, be kind at every opportunity, no one likes a jerk. TC: What can students do to teach themselves? What tools do they need? \nWD: Trial and error are the best teachers. Students must have a growth mindset, be willing to fail and try again. Each new attempt drives them relentlessly towards mastery. In terms of tools, all you need is an iPhone, the world\u2019s knowledge is actually at your fingertips.", "tags": "[\"quick key\", \"back to school\", \"Startups\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/walter-carter-newsletter.jpeg?w=240&h=320", "title": "Former Teacher And Current Entrepreneur Walter Duncan Offers Advice On Getting Things Done"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/uber-frankfurt-injunction/", "content": "Last month  on-demand ride-hailing\u00a0service Uber faced a ban in Berlin\u00a0on passenger safety grounds. That ban was  suspended\u00a0days later  while the court in question rules on the legality of the move. But Uber\u00a0is now facing another injunction in the country\u00a0\u2014 this time a district court in Frankfurt has issued a temporary ban against its\u00a0service which applies nationwide. The Frankfurt injunction, which was issued late last week, is reported to be enforceable until the start of any hearing appealing the ban \u2014 so is very likely to be lifted soon.\u00a0 Update:\u00a0 Uber has confirmed to TechCrunch that it intends to both appeal the injunction and to continue operating in Germany\u00a0ahead of its\u00a0appeal\u00a0(see below for the company\u2019s full statement). The civil action has been\u00a0brought by the German\u00a0taxi industry.\u00a0At issue is the lack of an official permit for Uber to operate in Germany\u00a0under its\u00a0Passenger Transport Act. The court accuses Uber of unfair competition vs regulated taxi industries, given that its\u00a0undercutting price model, which relies on drivers using their own cars to offer a ride-hailing service, could\u00a0mean corners are being cut on areas such as insurance. A report in  Spiegel Online \u00a0notes the Frankfurt injunction carries a penalty fine of \u20ac250,000/$330,000 per violation, and the threat of jail time\u00a0against Uber\u2019s directors. Dr Arne Hasse, of the Frankfurt court, confirmed the details of the injunction to TechCrunch\u00a0\u2014\u00a0noting via email: \u201cThe Uber App violates German unfair competition law. In Germany, commercial passanger transport is only allowed with a permission by the local authorities which the Uber drivers don\u2019t have.\u00a0The injunction was brought by a taxi drivers\u2019 union which also operates a taxi app. A hearing will only take place if Uber applies for it. The injunction is immediately enforceable; Uber can apply for a suspension of the immediately enforceability.\u201d In a statement provided to the  FT ,\u00a0Dieter Schlenker, chairman of taxi companies\u2019 co-operative Taxi Deutschland,\u00a0accused Uber of disingenuous behaviour, given how well funded the company is.\u00a0\u201cThe Passenger Transport Act regulates the protection of drivers and consumers. That can\u2019t easily be overturned no matter how neoliberal the company.\u00a0Uber operates with billions in cash from Goldman Sachs and Google, wraps itself in a Startup-Look and sells itself as a New Economy saviour,\u201d he said. Uber\u00a0has  a $17bn valuation ,\u00a0huge funding muscle and a swathe of big name backers, including the aforementioned\u00a0 Google  and  Goldman Sachs , fueling its expansion. In this latest bump in the ride-sharing road, Uber is able to \u2014 and doubtless will \u2014 object to the Frankfurt injunction and ask for an annulment of the court\u2019s decision. It certainly has the overflowing coffers to lean in to lengthy legal battles.\u00a0The company\u00a0filed an objection to the\u00a0earlier ban in Berlin, and has been able to continue operating there in the legal interim. It has also previously faced a ban\u00a0in Hamburg, and\u00a0 recently was able to have that overturned . At the time of writing Uber had not responded to a request for comment but the company told Spiegel Online it will fight the latest injunction in Germany. We\u2019ll update this story with any statement from the company.   Update:\u00a0 Uber provided the following statement to TechCrunch:\u00a0\u201cGermany is one of the fastest growing markets for Uber in Europe. We will continue to operate in Germany and will appeal the recent lawsuit filed by Taxi Deutschland in Frankfurt. We believe innovation and competition is good for everyone, riders and drivers, everyone wins. You cannot put the brakes on progress. Uber will continue its operations and will offer Uberpop ridesharing services via its app throughout Germany.\u200b\u201d It is unclear whether Uber will cover any fines incurred for drivers breaking the injunction, or whether the\u00a0drivers themselves will be left to pay any\u00a0penalties out of their own pocket.\u00a0We\u2019ve asked Uber\u00a0for clarification on this point and will update this story with any response.", "tags": "[\"germany\", \"Uber\", \"Apps\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-02-at-9-54-32-am.png?w=700", "title": "Uber Slapped With Nationwide Injunction In Germany \u2014 But Vows To Continue To Operate"},

An\u00a0investor in oDesk once said, \u201cTwo middlemen seems like one too many.\u201d It was a pivotal statement that solidified the early focus on providing direct connections between employers and freelancers anywhere in the world. Everything we did in the early days of oDesk to support and benefit these direct connections paid off. Everything we did to accommodate other middlemen in the process was a waste of time. I\u2019ll be the first to confess that I know basically nothing about the book publishing industry and look forward to being enlightened by readers\u2019 comments.\u00a0Until then, this is\u00a0how I see it as a marketplace investor with Sigma West. Hachette\u00a0is a middleman. So is Amazon. There should be only one. The arguments for\u00a0Hachette\u00a0go something like this: without great publishers, there will be fewer great writers, and emerging talents will have a harder time establishing themselves. For  at least 900 authors , this is a scary proposition .  Publishers do provide valuable services of talent discovery, quality control and distribution. But let\u2019s look at each one of these points and see how things could be better with fewer middlemen. Take a look at Apple\u2019s App Store. They\u2019ve effectively destroyed the old guard of video game publishers. It\u2019s only in the last few years that an independent game developer from Vietnam could end up with the  No. 1 game in the world . That developer probably never would have been discovered by EA.\u00a0 Platforms like the App Store or Amazon can do a better job of talent discovery than the status quo, because they lower the barriers to entry for aspiring app developers or authors. They give everyone a chance. I don\u2019t hear consumers complaining about the lack of good games available. On the contrary, mobile gaming is hotter than ever. A platform like Amazon will get data about user conversion rates and user ratings much faster than anyone else and can let the cream rise to the top. Granted, they will not discover authors before they ever write a book, but as soon as a title is available for sale, Amazon can take care of the rest. An aspiring author that self-publishes a title that resonates with readers will rise to the top of the charts in a meritocratic platform like Amazon. We should be embracing meritocratic platforms. Others have argued that\u00a0Hachette\u00a0and other publishers are necessary for quality curation. They do have many great editors. However, I can assure you that platforms like Amazon and all other marketplaces consider quality curation a top priority. Amazon demonstrated this priority in 2005 when it\u00a0acquired a company called BookSurge, which\u00a0provides editing and printing services to independent authors. BookSurge has since merged and rebranded as  CreateSpace . CreateSpace may  not be the best service , but as with many things at Amazon, they start with an experiment and improve the service over time. Platforms like Amazon want to make it easier and cheaper for anyone to publish great quality content. They have a long way to go to improve the service, but either they will get there or a new marketplace for high-quality editors or independent publishers will spring up. Amazon is unquestionably the best distribution platform for authors. Nobody else is even close. The value of being able to distribute across various different brick-and-mortar bookstores is diminishing every day and the ability to intelligently optimize digital distribution is now of paramount importance. The bonus for authors  should be  increased earnings over time. This is critical \u2013 great authors must have the incentive to work with fewer middlemen. Increased efficiency in the process means that prices can come down and authors can make higher earnings overall. They will sell more and retain a higher percentage of earnings since there are fewer big hands in the cookie jar. See  here  for a review of Amazon from a small independent publisher and their payment policies. The bonus for the world is that eliminating middlemen makes the world more economically efficient and maybe even more educated. Prices come down and the amount of reading goes up. The lessons for other marketplaces here are straightforward. Align the incentives of the buyer and supplier and, if possible, ignore the incentives of other middlemen. Provide the tools necessary for individuals to thrive and help them achieve their full potential. Empower aspiring professionals, lower barriers to entry, let the cream rise to the top, and make sure you\u2019re the only middleman left standing.", "tags": "[\"Hachette\", \"Amazon\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/books-shutterstock_112295444.jpg?w=738", "title": "Amazon Vs.

Investors include family offices, large institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds, including the European Investment Fund. The fund will, as before, focus on early and growth stage companies in northern Europe, particularly the UK, Germany, and the Nordics with an allocation for US companies expanding into Europe. Nenad Marovac, founder and managing partner, said the raise was \u201cwell ahead of our target and significantly oversubscribed.\u201d He says there are \u201cterrific start-ups in the European market at the moment.\u201d This is DN\u2019s largest fund to date. DN Capital now has $320 million in total under management and has invested in around 50 companies since 2000. The Pan-European early-stage venture capital firm typically invests \u20ac1-10 million per company depending on investment stage. In the wider marketplace, London\u2019s Index Ventures raised a new fund this year of $550 million, while over the road, Balderton Capital raised $305 million earlier this year. Last year Accel Partners in London raised an early stage fund of $475 million. According to data from Dow Jones VentureSource European startups have raised more than $2.8 billion (\u20ac2.1 billion) from VCs in the second quarter of 2014, the highest quarterly total since that iconic dot-com bust year of 2001. The UK remains the biggest country, where companies have raised 28% of the total amount in the second quarter, followed by France with 19% and Germany with 15%. London-based Index Ventures was the busiest VC firm in Europe, with 16 deals completed, according to VentureSource. What\u2019s clear from all this however is that European VC funds are taking advantage of the resurgence of tech startups to raise new funds. There are also many more exits happening. There were 92 European tech \u201cexits\u201d in the second quarter of 2014, of which 10 were IPOs. This is up from 54 deals tracked in Q1 2014, an increase of about 70 percent,  according to Tech.eu . Already this year, two London companies have been sold for some \u00a31bn in total \u2013 Artificial Intelligence startup DeepMind was bought by Google while Zynga bought games company Natural Motion. This year the IPO on the London Stock Market of property portal Zoopla attracted blue-chip investors to its \u00a3900m / $1.53m floatation, and the share price has gained since then. According to CrunchBase , DN Capital\u2019s Investments so far this year include: PurpleBricks \nReal Estate Agency \n$13.4M / Series A with 3 other investors Quandoo \nAn online reservation platform \n$25M / Series C with 5 other investors Book a Tiger \nOnline booking platform for professional cleaners. \nundisclosed amount / Seed with 2 other investors Hybrid Logic \n$1.4M / Seed with 2 other investors Ombud \nSocial IT Research Platform \nundisclosed amount / Seed Vint Training \nP2P Marketplace for Fitness Instructors \n$1.8M / Seed with 2 other investors eWings.com \nProfessional flight bookings \nundisclosed amount / Seed with 1 other investor", "tags": "[\"DN Capital\", \"Europe\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-02-at-10-09-40.png?w=738", "title": "DN Capital Raises $200M For 3rd European Fund, As Euro Tech Resurges"},
{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/01/mashr-resurrects-tinder-experiment/", "content": "In May 2013, Tinder introduced Matchmaker, a way for users of the popular dating app to introduce their Facebook friends to each other. \u201cRight now introductions are a very difficult process,\u201d Tinder Ceo Sean\u00a0Rad  said\u00a0at the time . \u201cThey\u2019re slow, they\u2019re socially awkward. This is socially a acceptable environment for you to make introductions in an easy way.\u201d Matchmaker\u00a0has since been phased out of Tinder, but a\u00a0new startup,  Mashr , is resurrecting\u00a0the feature\u00a0as its central thesis. Rad\u2019s quote about the friction of introductions still rings true over a year later, and Mashr co-founder  Brian Nichols  argues that Matchmaker did not succeed because it wasn\u2019t a true piece of the core Tinder experience. Mashr is straightforward: a user pairs two of their friends together and offers a quick explanation on why they should meet. If both agree Mashr makes the connection much like Tinder. Nichols is counting on the fact that I might actually go out with Rachel if my friend Lindsey introduces us and explains why we\u2019re compatible, instead of if we just swiped right for each other on Tinder. \u201cI know Tinder is all the rage these days, but does it really make sense to meet up with a complete stranger?,\u201d Nichols argues. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it make more sense (and be safer) if you were connected by a friend to your future significant other?\u201d Will Mashr really be able to succeed with\u00a0an experiment that Tinder abandoned? \u201cPeople are on Tinder for themselves, to play the game of tinder,\u201d Nichols argues, explaining that he is in a relationship but has many friends who are looking for dates who he\u2019d like to easily introduce. Nichols co-founded Mashr with Michael and Will Perl, two brothers who attended Stanford and also co-founded a company called\u00a0 Naquatic, \u00a0whose\u00a0apps have accumulated over 35 million downloads. Nichols, who met the Perl brothers through mutual friends, convinced them to step outside of building games to take a shot at creating a new dating app in Mashr. Besides Tinder, Nichols says Mashr primarily competes with Hinge, which connects users because they share a mutual or third degree Facebook friend, and CoffeeMeetsBagel, which restricts users to one match per day in order to make those matches more meaningful. He argues that Mashr\u2019s human matching can do better than other app\u2019s algorithms. Users on Mashr can pair any of their Facebook friends together, even if those friends haven\u2019t downloaded Mashr yet; those friends will then get a Facebook notification about the proposed match, which the team hopes will drive app downloads. In addition to the primary one-to-one matching aspect of the app, Mashr has a few gamification\u00a0aspects to\u00a0galvanize\u00a0users to mash their friends together.\u00a0MashPlay is a timed game where you try to match as many friends together as quickly as possible.\u00a0MashFeed shows a list of all the mashes people are making\u2013not just the successful ones. This aspect of the app is intriguing, but could backfire. The team hopes it will cause people to check the feed regularly to see who of their friends might be getting matched, but many people wouldn\u2019t want others to see who they\u2019re being matched with. \u201cWe want a really casual, fun and funny experience that also has the opportunity to make meaningful connections between two people,\u201d Nichols says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to strike that balance.\u201d You can download Mashr now for  iOS  and  Android .

Prior to that,\u00a0he was the CEO and co-founder of buzzumi, a cloud, enterprise software company. Scientific, Technical, and Medical (STM) publishing is big business. It generates $19 billion in revenue per year, the majority of which is earned by a few powerful publishers that\u00a0enjoy profit margins of up to 40 percent. Inflated subscriptions sold to academic libraries keep them moving ahead because the librarians feel they have no choice but to buy. These companies add little value to the actual publishing product but they are entrenched. Many forces are now at work to change the status quo which has existed for more than 100 years. The primitive publishing model employed by these publishers is actually a detriment to science. Research paid for by taxpayers is often restricted behind pay walls, major breakthroughs that could potentially save lives languish in articles whose publication is delayed for no reason. In some cases, published findings that have passed a traditional peer review process are subsequently found to be fraudulent. \u00a0 Performed behind a smokescreen of anonymity, these publishers are the master puppeteers pulling the strings of scientific research to no one\u2019s benefit but their own.\u00a0The issue is that science publishing is not an esoteric academic silo with no impact on the world. Scientific findings ultimately affect every human being on the planet. Something has to change. Until now, despite moving from paper to pixels, the publication of scientific research had not harnessed the full potential of the internet. Most journals still use a system that\u2019s rooted in the pre-web era of print and its associated rhythms and rules. Although solving some of these problems requires a significant cultural shift in academia, many of them are solvable using existing technologies that are already standard in other industries and in the culture of the web at large. It normally takes months \u2013 even years \u2013 before a submitted article is published. This delay is not only frustrating for researchers, but it limits scientific progress and there is no defensible reason for it. Part of the delay is caused by journals rejecting papers they don\u2019t find interesting enough, but the major factor delaying publication is the academic peer review process. Traditionally, journals only publish articles after they have been approved by other researchers in the field. The idea that an article can only be published  after  this lengthy process is completely outmoded given the immediacy of the Internet and the culture of social media and blogs. We can, and should, post new insights immediately. Solutions Pre-print servers such as  arXiv , where authors can upload manuscripts directly, are already popular in physics and are now starting to be used in biology, as well. There is now a new breed of journal that takes this idea one step further, and arranges formal, invited peer review for articles that have been published online before review, thereby allowing access to information usually months before a traditional journal. Another issue with peer review, aside from the enormous delays it causes, is its anonymity. Most journals use a system where the peer reviewers know who wrote the article, but the articles\u2019 authors and readers do not know who reviewed it. All sorts of potential for abuses arises from smoky rooms. Expert peer reviewers are by default working in the same area which may also make them competitors, creating incentives to be overly critical, or even to deliberately try to hold back a study that competes with their own work. That never serves the interest of science and is completely at odds with the increasing transparency seen in most industries and across the Internet these days. Solutions In 2000, publisher  BioMed Central  started publishing the names of reviewers for the articles in their medical series of journals, and since then, a growing number of journals have made reviewers and/or referee reports public. This helps foster a culture of transparency and dialogue, which are fundamental to good science. \u00a0 Scientists try to publish in the top journals in their field to compete for a small number of jobs. These journals, by design, exercise a very selective approach to what they publish \u2014 what appears to be the most \u201cexciting\u201d work. The tragedy is that people are very poor judges of what will ultimately prove to be important \u2014 and often more radical but important findings may be discounted or ignored for decades before being \u201cdiscovered.\u201d As a side effect, scientists don\u2019t\u00a0publish work that will not directly advance their career. Think of experiments that didn\u2019t show the expected outcome, half-finished projects by people who left the lab, or even small \u2013 yet interesting \u2013 findings that are not part of their main research project. Collectively, these unpublished studies and data form a big body of knowledge that can advance scientific knowledge and represent a significant percentage of all research and billions of dollars of research money. Any insight that has been gleaned should be published. Solutions A small number of journals do encourage the publication of negative results, and even allow \u201cresearch notes,\u201d which can describe just a single experiment rather than a complex study. Researchers can also upload slide decks to Slideshare, and deposit data in repositories such as Figshare, or topic-specific databases. The underlying data behind published studies are also typically kept hidden while researchers try to build their careers by maximizing the number of new discoveries they can get out of the data they produced. When it is released, it is often so poorly presented that it is impossible for anyone else to reuse it or understand it, and the code used to analyse it is missing. Taken together, this leads to bias in the scientific record, makes it hard for others to try to reproduce new discoveries or build on their findings, limits the reproducibility of research findings and slows down scientific discovery. If you make a claim, you should be forced to prove it by showing your full data set, something that would have greatly benefitted the  recently retracted STAP papers  published in  Nature  and proved beneficial when the data was included in  the attempted replication of this work . Solutions Journals like F1000Research and PLOS are now requiring authors to include the underlying data and the analysis code with each published article. With an increasing number of repositories available for scientific data \u2014 topic-specific databases, institutional repositories, or services like Figshare or DataVerse \u2014 there is no shortage of places to deposit research data. But even with available tech and incentives, not all researchers like the idea of sharing their data: What if someone uses their\u00a0data to make their own discoveries and scoop them in the next step of the project? This mindset is especially pervasive in the biomedical sciences, which are connected to the huge industries of medtech, biotech, and pharma. There are few commercial applications for cutting-edge mathematical research so those fields don\u2019t suffer from the same pressure for secrecy. The culture of scientific publishing is complex. Some problems need technical solutions, but others require a cultural change within academia. Just a few examples of solutions that are still needed: Tech companies, publishers, academics, funders and other stakeholders all need to work together to find these solutions. The first steps have been made and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing scientific publishing become faster, fairer and transparent.", "tags": "[\"academic publishing\", \"scientific publishing\", \"Column\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/shutterstock_209934835-e1409432908316.jpg?w=738", "title": "How The Digital Revolution Can Fix Scientific Publishing And Speed Up Discoveries"},

Emprego Ligado  is a job marketplace that\u00a0competes with local job sites and staffing agencies for blue-collar Brazilians by using the cellphone to full effect. In 2012 it received \u00a0backing from investors  including 500 Startups and Initial Capital to crack the Brazilian market.

{"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/02/facebook-has-restored-some-facial-recognition-in-europe-tagging-u-s-friends-photos/", "content": "In 2012,  Facebook  came under fire from privacy advocates and  eventually turned off \u00a0all facial recognition services in the EU, which automatically recognised and suggested the names of friends from photos that you uploaded to the social network.\u00a0But did you know that Facebook appears to have restored an aspect\u00a0of the service in Europe? Facebook\u00a0is now suggesting\u00a0photo tags\u00a0to users uploading pictures to Facebook in Europe, but only\u00a0if the photo subjects\u00a0are friends from the U.S., and  only  if those friends\u00a0have enabled tag suggest functionality\u00a0on their profiles. The resurfacing\u00a0of Facebook\u2019s \u201ctag suggest\u201d, as the facial recognition feature is known, was first brought to my attention\u00a0by a Facebook Friend. Doing some tests\u00a0on my own timeline and those of a couple of other friends whose accounts are registered in the EU, here is what\u00a0we\u00a0found: If you upload a picture of a friend whose account is registered as being in the U.S., and that person has enabled the feature for identifying his or her image,\u00a0that person\u2019s\u00a0face is identified (to the best of Facebook\u2019s technology) and that person is tagged: This not impacting photos of EU users\u2019 faces, from what we understand. In other words, if you upload a picture with friends who are based in Europe, they are not\u00a0tagged.\u00a0If you upload a picture of two people, with one in the U.S. and the other not, only the U.S. person gets tagged, if he\u2019s enabled the feature in his privacy settings. Like here: It seems that this is a recent change: as you can see in the first picture above, you are also now getting a prompt for tag suggestions to add other tags and see other suggestions from Facebook. It seems that the tag icon in the corner is only programmed to come up for some pictures \u2014 the ones that fit the above criteria. The way this works\u00a0has been confirmed for me by friends based in the UK, and it\u2019s working exactly the same in Germany, too, my friend  Matth\u00e4us Krzykowski \u00a0tells me. We have reached out to Facebook for more details about what is going on here, when they turned this on, and whether there is more to come. For now, here is some context: The \u201ctag suggest\u201d feature was something that Facebook has been using and developing for some time now, partly bolstered by technology from\u00a0Face.com, an Israeli startup that it  acquired in 2012 . At least some of Face.com\u2019s\u00a0employees are  still working for Facebook . But while tag suggest has been humming along in markets like the U.S., Facebook \u00a0turned it off for users in\u00a0Europe back in September 2012 , in response to a  list of features that Facebook needed to change on its platform, which were flagged by Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Authority (DPA) . The DPA\u00a0report was compiled\u00a0in response to a privacy complaint made in 2011 by none other than Max Schrems \u2014 the same Austrian law student\u00a0who is now leading the charge on a  class action suit  against the company over alleged privacy violations (a\u00a0 thorn in Facebook\u2019s side, indeed ).* Because Facebook\u2019s international headquarters is in Ireland, rulings made by courts and regulators in that market have wide-ranging ramifications, and the decisions impact how Facebook operates across the European Union. But although Facebook made a very clear decision in 2012\u00a0to cut the facial recognition feature off for all new European users, and to delete all tag suggest data for existing European users by October of that year, it also left a loophole for how it could live to tag suggest another day. \u201cAs our regulator in Europe, the Irish Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is constantly working with us to ensure that we keep improving on the high standards of control that we have built into our existing\u00a0tools,\u201d a spokesperson said at the time. \u201cThis audit is part of an ongoing process of oversight, and we are pleased that,\u00a0as the Data Protection Commissioner said, the latest announcement is confirmation that we are not only compliant with European data protection law but we have gone beyond some of their initial recommendations and are fully committed to best practice in data protection compliance.\u201d The\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0goes on, however, to make\u00a0clear that\u00a0Facebook will be revisiting facial recognition when it figures out how to square it with the regulators: \u201cIt\u2019s worth us reiterating that once we have agreed on an approach on the best way to notify and educate users with the DPC, we hope to bring back this useful tool.\u201d While that\u00a0day not\u00a0arrived, what we seem to have here is at least a small step in that direction. *For more context\u2026. the argument for Schrems and others opposed to things like facial recognition on Facebook is that it gives less control to individuals for how they are tagged and organised and potentially monetized in Facebook\u2019s database. The other side of the debate is that this can be a useful way of tagging and alerting friends to pictures of them, and it\u2019s not clear that the data is repurposed in the way that\u00a0would negatively affect your experience on the service. I\u2019m personally in favor of\u00a0more control of your data, if that is what you personally want, because that still gives individuals\u00a0the option of having less control if you actually don\u2019t care one way or the other. Post updated throughout with more clarification about how only\u00a0users in the U.S. who\u00a0have enabled\u00a0tag suggest will come up with suggested tags in photos uploaded by their Facebook networks\u00a0in Europe.", "tags": "[\"photos\", \"facial recognition\", \"Facebook\", \"Europe\"]", "url_image": "http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/reasons-of-facebook-privacy-concerns.jpg?w=413 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/blurred-test.png?w=518&h=340 http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/fbmk1.png?w=248&h=209", "title": "Euro Facebook Users Can Use Tag Suggest, For Photos Of U.S. Friends Who Have It Enabled"}]
